{"chunk":"After eating, carbohydrates break down into glucose, which enters the bloodstream. The pancreas releases insulin, which signals cells to absorb glucose. This lowers blood sugar levels and provides energy to cells. Insulin ensures balanced blood sugar levels. It helps store excess glucose in the liver, muscles, and fat cells for later use. Proper insulin function supports overall health by preventing high and low blood sugar levels. Insulin as a BiomarkerInsulin levels in the blood serve as an important biomarker for metabolic conditions. High insulin levels can indicate insulin resistance, while low levels may suggest issues with insulin production. Insulin levels are crucial for diagnosing and managing diseases like diabetes. They help track disease progression and treatment effectiveness, providing valuable insights into an individual's metabolic health. Measuring Insulin LevelsInsulin is measured via blood tests. Blood samples are taken to measure the amount of insulin in the bloodstream. These are the most common methods for measuring insulin:\n\nFasting Insulin Levels: This test measures insulin after an overnight fast, providing information about how the body manages insulin without the influence of recent food intake. Insulin Tolerance Tests: These tests measure insulin levels after administering glucose to see how the body responds. Upload your blood test results to Docus AI Doctor for a comprehensive analysis and receive easy-to-understand interpretation and tailored health recommendations.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More\nNormal vs. Abnormal Insulin Levels\nNormal Insulin Levels: According to the University of Rochester, a normal measurement of free insulin is less than 17 mcU\/mL. However, these ranges can vary based on the laboratory and the individual. Abnormal Insulin Levels: High insulin levels might indicate insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes. Low insulin levels can suggest type 1 diabetes or other issues with insulin production. Factors That Can Affect Insulin Measurement and InterpretationSeveral factors can affect the accuracy of insulin measurement and its interpretation:\n\nDiet and Fasting State: Recent food intake can alter insulin levels. Fasting samples provide more consistent results. Medications: Some medications can interfere with insulin production and metabolism, affecting levels. Stress and Physical Activity: Both can cause fluctuations in insulin levels, complicating the assessment. Biological Variability: Individual differences, such as genetic factors and health conditions, can influence insulin levels. Understanding and accounting for these factors is crucial for accurately using insulin as a biomarker in clinical practice. Limitations in Using Insulin as a BiomarkerWhile insulin is a valuable biomarker, it has limitations. Insulin levels can fluctuate significantly throughout the day, influenced by various factors such as food intake, stress, and physical activity. This variability can make it challenging to obtain consistent and reliable measurements. Additionally, different laboratories may use varying reference ranges, complicating the interpretation of results across different healthcare settings. Insulin: Predictive Biomarker and Health Implications\nRole of Insulin in DiabetesInsulin plays a critical role in managing diabetes, a condition where the body struggles with insulin production or usage:\n\nType 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to little or no insulin production. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require insulin injections to manage their blood sugar levels.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health","embedding":[0.0122922501,0.0245009903,-0.0273477864,-0.0437069833,-0.0103920558,0.0571231283,-0.0038307772,0.0337367319,-0.0736247376,0.0024312651,-0.0035408796,0.0159388576,0.0300424322,-0.0477982461,-0.0300494991,-0.0573818088,0.0115973838,-0.0179516766,-0.0694670603,-0.0269345753,-0.0088944416,-0.0228405669,-0.0183993764,-0.0162347369,-0.0178867839,-0.0354711898,0.0074028391,0.0759542659,0.0383260064,-0.0160431601,0.040328633,0.0250388682,0.0414779596,-0.0569729693,0.088181898,-0.0135574564,-0.0116113927,0.0445279777,0.0711666644,-0.0962678716,-0.0229753405,-0.0295182932,-0.0176140051,0.0227189958,-0.074766472,0.0043841987,0.0067811483,0.063660726,0.0160801634,0.0510639399,0.0405074693,0.0122794556,-0.0655582324,0.0244737025,-0.0508539192,-0.0146558825,-0.0246918574,0.000986489,0.0303587578,0.0198890436,-0.0333993584,-0.0373156704,-0.0436533317,-0.0405422896,0.0345494598,-0.0158074722,-0.0348287784,-0.0552966371,-0.0761508644,0.0155084264,-0.0034899367,0.0302824806,-0.0361128002,0.0199716222,0.0357338376,-0.0050260173,0.0189529657,-0.0205221977,-0.0032752622,0.0066734077,-0.0397073068,0.0141157126,0.0309992991,0.092783384,-0.0011621948,0.0120368199,0.0507343225,-0.1063141823,-0.0162549075,0.057593964,0.1305254698,-0.011941066,0.0157017186,-0.000134786,0.0655520856,-0.0259903017,-0.0774097219,-0.0412346311,0.1315413117,0.0259511061,0.0276102647,-0.025957197,0.0068772114,-0.0140909292,0.0453144759,0.0156315826,0.0330951586,-0.048734501,0.014141717,0.0355027504,0.0168600176,0.01402188,-0.0022602146,-0.0247830246,0.0495815873,-0.0052307369,0.0052060699,0.0291837957,-0.0672639832,-0.0362889916,-0.0129219797,0.0119133424,-0.0029924382,-0.0016602114,0.0271646082,-0.0025965441,-0.0021125907,-0.0442633703,-0.0326793157,0.0183570404,0.0296072625,-0.0510003045,0.0070907506,0.0484627299,0.0063781086,0.0213980228,0.0337788872,0.0214817394,-0.048216451,0.0401663631,-0.0188077725,-0.0628868937,-0.0804041401,-0.0093612783,-0.0502137356,-0.0242557991,0.012621657,0.0087026879,-0.0161565207,-0.0416209698,-0.0467831567,-0.0403054208,0.0942404792,0.0061130873,-0.0059544141,0.0258687492,0.0552754775,0.0023024776,0.0423666127,0.0076573831,-0.0115288701,-0.0883231089,0.0250362661,0.0229590591,-0.0658512339,0.0027302494,-0.0220744405,-0.0558841303,0.0068856925,0.0106973154,-0.0435629562,0.0129082045,-0.0707596019,-0.1504380107,0.0136006502,0.0471947044,-0.0255938731,-0.0546152219,-0.0120943272,-0.0526125059,0.042588491,-0.0505847186,0.0153203132,-0.1103021502,-0.0079664905,0.0738239884,0.0122849112,-0.0073875575,0.0503995009,0.0207480527,-0.0220025051,-0.0245336667,0.0028811204,-0.0276356637,0.0232899822,0.0240458958,0.0098031852,0.0105340872,0.0248726327,-0.011226831,0.0489058793,-0.0518368743,0.0600670986,-0.0077708275,-0.0031878606,-0.0340709053,-0.0541061386,-0.0073000374,0.0214087609,-0.0166717004,0.0034180433,-0.0586720742,-0.0091041075,-0.0127864061,0.015405288,0.0201574806,-0.0218305159,-0.0034589085,0.0230890363,-0.0148353279,0.0020126267,-0.0352266543,0.0420354381,0.0395138338,0.0249413475,0.069131799,-0.0148212034,-0.0199949592,0.0179064684,-0.0120883007,0.0126733948,0.0327947065,-0.0333414674,-0.0154101588,-0.0099118687,-0.0188598484,-0.0085526723,-0.0357410908,-0.009606163,-0.0320892222,0.0068420726,0.0771924034,0.0004745499,-0.0370881557,0.0075978758,-0.0225018095,0.0317450538,0.0261036623,-0.0303098224,-0.0247481223,0.0216529146,-0.0264476258,-0.001202488,-0.0323744677,-0.0452075787,0.0031657107]}
{"chunk":"Type 2 Diabetes: Characterized by insulin resistance or insufficient insulin production. Management includes lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet and regular exercise, and sometimes medication to improve insulin sensitivity. Gestational Diabetes: Occurs during pregnancy due to hormonal changes causing insulin resistance. It typically resolves after childbirth but can increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. Insulin Resistance and Its ImplicationsInsulin resistance occurs when cells in muscles, fat, and the liver do not respond well to insulin, causing the pancreas to produce more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels.","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health","embedding":[-0.023295993,0.0084685134,-0.0330086686,-0.0443726666,-0.068763271,0.0540774055,0.0554359183,0.0398311093,-0.0723922625,0.0050179982,0.002886205,0.0371997021,0.0615485236,-0.0420752764,-0.0037166092,-0.0391783714,0.0332435966,-0.0238503553,-0.0287646111,0.0222398974,-0.0114669623,-0.0451409221,-0.0059600519,-0.0100634824,-0.0363516659,-0.0377871618,0.0005373766,0.0166839212,0.0480852127,-0.0477565899,0.0745895058,0.0538369156,0.0449817814,-0.0391973071,0.0496788025,-0.0402981378,0.0002435836,0.0312715061,0.0318282433,-0.0292685498,-0.0363944173,-0.0591122918,-0.0084203621,-0.0102150943,-0.0581884086,-0.0275192503,-0.0101795094,0.046240326,0.0066569061,0.0469828136,0.0188474227,0.0081111314,-0.0413622297,0.048817534,-0.009122327,-0.0261335764,-0.0592007563,-0.0346035734,0.0005270572,-0.0133558847,-0.0355353653,-0.0134510463,-0.0246106256,-0.0447966531,0.047031261,-0.045066379,-0.0381739363,-0.0480911545,-0.0516056679,0.0767789036,0.0196796563,0.0409433618,-0.0585397817,-0.0048378576,0.0377880298,-0.0026975956,-0.0009287717,-0.0786384568,-0.0058843251,0.0057297656,-0.02985988,0.0306802951,0.0405482277,0.1379928291,-0.0360916182,0.0399659462,0.0140956203,-0.0365257189,-0.0296420697,0.0049760402,0.1296424568,0.0293401144,0.0160427168,0.0091722729,0.041076269,0.0180481542,-0.0740652531,-0.0579098836,0.0968828723,0.0033540993,0.0332236923,-0.0065865233,0.0313751027,-0.0435148664,0.0497828536,0.0096717151,0.0396667086,-0.0881569088,-0.0302124135,0.0462963246,0.0173475016,-0.0061981566,-0.0187584385,-0.0127988672,0.0393636897,-0.0218780618,-0.0145999864,-0.0024111366,-0.0652051717,-0.0313376114,-0.0035434994,0.0066825985,-0.0113747707,0.0070472145,0.0625947714,0.0106822643,0.0192817617,-0.0158062335,-0.0747050345,0.0145222023,0.0614218265,-0.0423937477,0.00694117,0.0282583684,0.0353772156,0.0178037193,0.0239255652,0.0336320028,-0.0052153282,0.0128173316,-0.0092638778,-0.0509029403,-0.0353238173,0.0057056923,-0.0445615351,-0.0473230444,0.0061836517,0.0405394919,-0.0108620087,-0.0319643058,-0.0562790595,-0.0063725347,0.1282066107,0.0165938325,0.0033084871,0.0205865223,0.0313328505,0.0260873735,0.0699922517,0.0023642597,0.0405423045,-0.0325691141,0.048704505,0.010999524,-0.0239163376,0.0130774304,-0.0077027301,0.0038103026,-0.018737331,-0.0072980085,-0.0182109214,0.0041942331,-0.0052711293,-0.1957509369,0.0120950779,-0.0055766813,-0.0025226267,-0.0432794355,0.0266786348,-0.0391868874,0.0751613602,0.0336387493,-0.0134235434,-0.0806206614,0.0033590957,0.027121054,0.0124745807,0.0318281725,0.0437754691,0.0319703408,-0.0032753665,-0.0311622098,-0.0539020337,0.0263789389,0.0329626016,0.0414767191,-0.0118821412,0.0193700343,0.022053007,-0.0466373414,0.0466119833,-0.012451876,0.045153264,-0.005174946,0.0047512213,-0.0109741557,-0.0328078866,-0.0293450113,0.0180311315,-0.0358904079,0.0082662357,-0.0224177744,-0.0173842665,-0.0038837865,0.0485116281,-0.0086435787,0.0229296647,-0.0355697162,0.0244979709,-0.0366698168,0.0058248327,-0.0443219803,0.0414183363,0.0686137676,0.041562099,0.0521178469,-0.043620497,-0.0060367626,0.0072063417,0.0167073235,-0.0163295753,0.0354771353,-0.0325140357,-0.000865577,-0.0384670086,-0.0044686468,-0.0274091549,-0.0278132278,-0.0225521009,-0.0400191769,0.0247246921,0.0586857535,0.0580667108,-0.0309634842,0.0001001912,-0.0394292884,0.0718567893,0.0032127961,-0.0155686708,-0.0230439603,0.0517549329,-0.0429527238,0.0336304419,-0.02179306,-0.0438147411,-0.000709019]}
{"chunk":"Over time, this can lead to type 2 diabetes and other health issues like high blood pressure and heart disease. For example, Frontiers in Endocrinology published a study that focused on insulin as an early indicator for metabolic disorders. Elevated fasting insulin levels are linked to a higher risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Insulin resistance is a significant factor in many metabolic disorders and requires careful management to prevent further health complications. Metabolic SyndromeMetabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. These conditions include high blood sugar, increased blood pressure, excess body fat around the waist, and abnormal cholesterol levels. High insulin levels and insulin resistance are central to metabolic syndrome, highlighting the importance of monitoring and managing insulin levels to reduce the risk of these associated diseases. Insulin in Predicting Cardiovascular DiseasesInsulin resistance and elevated insulin levels are linked to a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases. When the body struggles to manage blood sugar levels, it can lead to hypertension, atherosclerosis, and other heart-related conditions. Monitoring insulin levels can help identify individuals at higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, enabling early intervention through dietary changes, exercise, and medications to manage blood pressure and cholesterol. Other ConditionsBeyond diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, insulin levels can predict other health issues:\n\nPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS): Women with PCOS often have insulin resistance and elevated insulin levels, contributing to symptoms like irregular periods and infertility. Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): Insulin resistance is a major factor in the development of NAFLD, a condition where fat builds up in the liver. Monitoring insulin levels provides valuable insights into various health conditions, allowing for timely and effective interventions to prevent and manage these diseases. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is insulin?Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps regulate blood sugar levels by allowing glucose to enter cells and provide energy.What does insulin do?Insulin helps move glucose from the bloodstream into cells, where it is used for energy. It also assists in storing excess glucose and breaking down fats and proteins.How is insulin used in diabetes treatment?Insulin is essential for managing blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. It is administered through injections or insulin pumps to ensure that glucose can enter cells and provide energy.What is insulin glargine?Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin used to provide a steady level of insulin over a 24-hour period, helping to maintain stable blood sugar levels throughout the day and night.How does insulin glargine differ from other types of insulin?Insulin glargine has a slow onset and a long duration of action, providing a consistent level of insulin, unlike rapid-acting insulins that work quickly and for a shorter duration.Why is insulin important for people with diabetes?Insulin is crucial for people with diabetes because their bodies either do not produce enough insulin or cannot use it effectively, leading to high blood sugar levels that need to be managed.Can insulin levels indicate other health issues?Yes, insulin levels can predict the risk of developing conditions like cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).Have more questions?Ask AI Doctor\n\n","book":"Insulin: What Your Blood Test Reveals About Your Health","embedding":[-0.0161160827,0.006535776,-0.0249907281,-0.052062083,-0.0101018995,0.0688480511,-0.0160335284,-0.0077872514,-0.0553872921,0.0043693623,-0.0103915259,0.0051237578,0.0215600953,-0.0361408927,-0.0170052275,-0.0839174092,0.017808307,-0.0177021753,-0.0394002013,0.0290062688,-0.0076886448,-0.0256280936,-0.0175806452,-0.0213371627,-0.0469566584,-0.0454733074,-0.0295021366,0.0649119392,0.0043580835,-0.0655192435,0.0186611786,0.0514885075,0.0173972454,-0.0569568723,0.0801056102,-0.0336750187,-0.0200718977,0.0320320949,0.0499594025,-0.0651639923,0.0262407456,-0.0607567653,-0.0114173433,0.0186497606,-0.0756209716,0.0035190114,0.0070920126,0.0380318835,-0.0082166968,0.0558865741,0.0416884273,-0.0009487158,-0.0215285365,0.0235815961,-0.0284686554,-0.0503588617,-0.0644038171,0.0164790321,0.0138344783,0.0158073492,-0.0264352355,-0.0579767153,-0.0454421267,-0.0263714846,0.0641001537,-0.0099909557,-0.0600061491,-0.042164579,-0.0404445753,0.0419118851,0.009340683,0.0481519289,-0.008182534,0.0118871219,0.0199526157,-0.0017762212,0.0277334414,-0.0433469824,0.0208660178,-0.0092475582,-0.0441793166,0.0089917332,0.0475942045,0.1166783273,-0.0310541987,0.0326464139,0.0180244874,-0.0968432724,-0.0272212364,0.0293387026,0.140847683,-0.0193991456,0.0409488454,0.0174902696,0.0642859638,-0.0144463908,-0.056617748,-0.0610442758,0.0774662942,0.0250410289,0.0441159829,-0.0363937393,0.0136701884,-0.04644759,0.0561241955,0.0225123949,0.0817076191,-0.0542454123,0.001719371,0.0710370168,0.0392795093,0.0120275244,-0.0252478123,-0.0057790512,0.037095014,-0.039718233,-0.0151959565,0.0362055637,-0.0566326566,-0.013556893,-0.008429694,0.0305651166,-0.0120871775,0.0258516576,0.0503101908,0.0176146757,-0.0000738444,-0.0508905388,-0.063854605,-0.0202650763,0.033869382,-0.0481418073,-0.0329716764,0.028801905,0.0345279947,0.0180321038,0.0213746578,0.0155659383,-0.0600225553,0.0110511016,0.0136867017,-0.0722085908,-0.0605861358,-0.0058058114,-0.034786094,-0.0611771531,0.0308165047,-0.01937191,0.0032394535,-0.0505736955,-0.0120909782,-0.0114222663,0.1060746014,0.014002068,0.0201942232,0.0504059047,0.035478048,0.0116854152,0.0454702377,0.0182302184,-0.0323571637,-0.0542476773,0.0150343925,0.0124113616,-0.0599137358,0.0285412353,-0.0062728557,-0.0699183643,-0.0371284783,0.008188297,-0.0331208035,0.0078706006,-0.0289817005,-0.1815809757,-0.0188109204,0.0286034252,-0.0253077969,-0.0271371473,-0.0044609872,-0.0746454373,0.0778659955,-0.0323511697,0.0355779864,-0.077695474,0.0102309361,0.0464757271,0.0120711541,-0.012120124,0.0842206329,0.0181173999,0.0024964628,0.0073230732,0.0143978698,0.0129834069,0.0229044519,0.0381073095,-0.0202907454,-0.0136489877,0.0668337718,-0.0078529632,0.0207205769,-0.027211288,0.0882440731,-0.0268189833,0.0049560159,-0.0018172121,-0.0487929247,-0.0073954337,0.031938199,-0.019521853,-0.0262771379,-0.0262363367,-0.0212261882,0.0069443504,0.0282102339,0.0234160479,0.0121406773,0.0046003764,0.0115653537,-0.0362878703,-0.0121315168,-0.0464425795,0.0004951179,0.0352420062,0.0079701366,0.0345756561,-0.0246544722,-0.03027937,0.0083639873,0.0062124007,0.0027823141,0.0062216599,-0.0339753702,0.0108653018,-0.0162182022,-0.0219710898,-0.012444335,-0.0166582782,0.0076666218,-0.0365102589,0.0147364158,0.0629620403,0.0148267224,-0.0381055214,0.0022567932,-0.036960341,0.1058171168,0.0174950957,-0.0151163517,-0.0593902953,0.0144083435,-0.0627174079,-0.0014509442,-0.0242645722,-0.0058018169,0.0078215171]}

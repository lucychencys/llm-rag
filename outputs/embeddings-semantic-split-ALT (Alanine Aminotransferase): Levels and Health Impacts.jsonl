{"chunk":"Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) is a critical enzyme predominantly found in the liver, playing a vital role in converting proteins into energy for liver cells. Elevated ALT levels in the bloodstream can be a sign of liver damage or other health issues, making it essential to understand what your ALT levels mean and when to get tested.ContentsWhat Is ALT?When Is ALT Testing Recommended?How Is ALT Testing Conducted?What Are the Normal ALT Levels?What Do Abnormal Levels Mean? What Is ALT?ALT is an enzyme that helps convert proteins into energy. While its major activity occurs in the liver, smaller amounts are found in the kidneys, heart, muscles, and pancreas. Typically, ALT levels in the blood are low. However, when liver cells are damaged, they release ALT into the bloodstream, leading to elevated levels. Monitoring ALT levels is crucial because it provides insight into liver health. Abnormally high or low ALT levels can indicate a range of health issues, from minor liver irritations to severe diseases like liver cancer.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More\nWhen Is ALT Testing Recommended?ALT testing is commonly prescribed when symptoms of liver disease appear. Some key indicators include:\n\nWeakness and fatigue\nItchy skin\nLoss of appetite\nDark-colored urine\nLight-colored stool\nStomach pain, nausea, vomiting\nJaundice (yellow skin or eyes)\nFamily history of liver disease\nExcessive alcohol consumption\nDrug use that can affect the liver\nObesity, diabetes, or metabolic syndrome\n\nHow Is ALT Testing Conducted?ALT levels are typically measured using a blood test, often as part of a Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP). To ensure accurate results, follow these preparation steps:\n\nFasting: Do not eat 8 hours before the test; you can drink water.","book":"ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase): Levels and Health Impacts","embedding":[0.0175946653,0.0419890508,-0.0214107335,-0.0553982668,0.0015168872,0.005361171,0.0013544095,0.0295833219,0.012682328,0.0167099126,0.0288024638,-0.0129511608,0.0116313407,-0.0332628861,-0.0050702784,-0.0298257712,-0.0586647801,0.0136046531,-0.0724307895,-0.0335992761,0.0184344593,-0.0084989853,0.0240785331,-0.0201550834,0.0203806274,0.0331323929,-0.023456566,-0.0042243446,0.0078309681,-0.0331775844,0.0032060263,-0.040851377,0.0419393256,0.0042718202,0.0933240354,0.0070966221,0.0083652474,0.0246926211,0.0249813441,-0.0440196693,-0.0181651004,0.0154264774,-0.0621314272,0.0349051207,-0.0789199769,-0.0524895117,0.0191335045,0.0461935103,-0.0372650959,0.0025254856,-0.0046668053,0.0341367051,-0.08226455,0.0131553346,-0.0485299714,-0.033685565,0.0583166443,-0.0204721149,0.0512167104,-0.0036727863,-0.0208755136,-0.0221416745,-0.014220668,-0.0361096151,-0.0001968464,-0.0490122065,0.003394021,-0.0413280241,-0.0377459154,-0.0355481245,-0.0090485541,-0.0533088557,-0.0611236058,0.0005360586,0.0007687731,0.0038709799,-0.0079857605,-0.0183254089,-0.0082954299,0.0321766548,-0.0630258173,-0.0360004827,0.0198731665,0.1242951006,0.0109990835,-0.036335893,0.0567868277,-0.0637528598,-0.0076272637,0.073575519,0.1127273068,0.0218629912,0.0246341284,0.0610877685,0.05378047,-0.0359083898,-0.1219576225,-0.0880547911,0.0414566211,0.0264745373,-0.0066939453,-0.0037050976,0.0119891781,-0.0088986391,0.0243830271,0.002527616,0.0179038681,-0.0142321335,-0.0155862225,-0.002607309,0.0640602931,-0.0228411332,0.0075780451,0.0068533551,0.027899012,-0.0013426152,-0.0148765426,0.0389899425,-0.0143937189,0.0007963341,0.026337754,0.0352078266,0.0365318656,-0.0037474518,0.0316120386,0.0279991869,-0.0263371151,0.0222700071,-0.0335234851,0.0182959829,-0.0222172812,-0.1299799979,0.0227456279,0.0250896737,0.0173155535,0.0151718669,0.0629327521,0.0069121337,-0.0460989438,0.0387914814,-0.0036218618,-0.073297672,-0.0972182155,-0.0180972461,-0.0243939944,-0.0214084368,0.033128839,-0.007329599,-0.0387066081,-0.0699457303,-0.0295506865,-0.0273363497,0.0373263471,-0.034656588,0.0065048691,0.0355873406,-0.0023039186,-0.0618615523,0.075747177,0.009937223,0.0014396234,-0.0781189948,0.0245918427,0.0617419071,-0.0596535504,0.0211526323,0.017953949,-0.0600827187,-0.0146698114,0.0133486874,-0.0113819437,-0.0622043237,-0.0429047011,-0.1792595237,0.0329607874,0.0110624013,-0.0433180034,-0.0341055356,0.0276910197,0.0155532388,0.0699380413,0.0053184954,0.0121286698,-0.1128705293,0.0036693555,0.0580549091,-0.0103241391,0.0277321171,0.0399535112,0.0059679444,-0.0030971281,-0.0249020122,0.0062586507,-0.0131939137,0.0323840007,0.0655543208,0.0085120937,0.0300147329,0.0460984632,-0.064275071,0.0405305736,-0.0232263859,0.0242911074,0.0396403261,0.022247307,0.0169857219,0.0019481395,-0.0190687366,0.007428932,-0.0074562631,-0.0016627881,-0.003565955,-0.0263613407,-0.0504306108,0.0230819043,-0.031979017,-0.0465459749,-0.0001988615,0.0444575027,-0.0255146548,0.0096247103,-0.0343536362,0.0141509119,0.0217845365,0.0257145856,0.0531633608,-0.0745690241,-0.0096777417,0.0268933848,-0.0282040425,-0.0298627466,0.003435594,-0.0433621965,-0.0616135225,-0.0501862653,-0.0260340106,-0.0018862917,0.029593654,0.0044432497,-0.0042902203,0.0130199557,-0.0035547139,0.0174512193,0.0157183502,0.0111838896,-0.0108143305,0.0477856845,0.0379563533,-0.0115625104,-0.0491214916,0.024380317,-0.0173333157,0.0013500251,-0.0309786648,0.0110819098,-0.0248389747]}

The body converts food into energy, and during this process, creatine, a vital molecule for energy production in muscle cells, is produced. Creatine eventually breaks down into creatinine at a relatively constant rate. Due to its consistent production, creatinine serves as a useful indicator for assessing renal function. It is typically filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Creatinine FunctionCreatinine plays no active role in the body but is a crucial indicator of kidney health. Since it is generated from muscle metabolism, its levels in the blood reflect how well the kidneys are functioning. If the kidneys are healthy and working properly, they efficiently filter out most of the creatinine, releasing it into the urine. However, if the kidneys are damaged, the levels of creatinine in the blood can increase, as filtration is impaired. How to Test Creatinine\nTesting MethodsCreatinine levels are typically measured through two primary testing methods, each providing insights into kidney function and overall health:\nBlood Test (Serum Creatinine Test)Blood test is the most common method for assessing creatinine levels and, by extension, kidney function. This test can be part of a basic metabolic panel (BMP) or a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), which includes various other important markers of metabolic and kidney health. A blood sample is drawn from a vein, usually from the arm, and analyzed in a laboratory. The results indicate how well the kidneys are filtering the creatinine out of the blood.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More\nUrine Test (24-Hour Urine Collection)A urine test involves collecting all urine produced in 24 hours. It provides a more comprehensive overview of kidney function over an entire day. The total volume of urine and the amount of creatinine in the urine are measured to assess how effectively the kidneys are removing creatinine from the bloodstream. Preparing for the TestTo ensure the most accurate results from a creatinine test, consider the following tips:\n\nHydration: Maintain normal fluid intake before the test. Excessive water consumption can dilute the blood and temporarily lower creatinine levels, while dehydration can increase them. Diet: Avoid consuming large amounts of meat or other protein-rich foods the day before the test, as they can temporarily increase creatinine levels. Physical Activity: Refrain from vigorous exercise for at least 24 hours before the test, as intense physical activity can elevate creatinine levels. Medication and Supplements: Inform your healthcare provider about any medications or supplements you are taking, as some can affect creatinine levels. Normal Creatinine Levels\nIn BloodThe typical range for serum creatinine, as provided by the Mayo Clinic:\n\nFor adult men: 0.74 to 1.35 mg\/dL (65.4 to 119.3 micromoles\/L)\nFor adult women: 0.59 to 1.04 mg\/dL (52.2 to 91.9 micromoles\/L)\n\nNote: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used. In UrineAccording to URMC, the normal ranges for creatinine excretion vary between men and women:\n\nMale: 0.8 to 1.8 g\/day (7 to 16 mmol\/day)\nFemale: 0.6 to 1.6 g\/day (5.3 to 14 mmol\/day)\n\nNote: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used. Factors Influencing LevelsAccording to the National Kidney Foundation, several factors can influence creatinine levels:\nFactors Potentially Elevating Creatinine Levels\nConsuming significant quantities of cooked meats. Using creatine supplements.","book":"Creatinine: Key Insights into Normal and Abnormal Levels","embedding":[0.0073740617,0.0511034466,-0.02899451,-0.0689194351,0.0016640602,0.0463503301,-0.0027702891,0.0040141363,-0.001901105,-0.0161555447,0.0135649294,0.0405395553,0.0370889902,-0.0342070647,-0.0436922871,-0.0560320206,-0.0006575103,-0.0563994423,-0.0801750347,-0.0313035548,0.0193887558,-0.0020885745,0.0537448116,-0.007528069,0.0188675057,-0.0119870165,0.0225219876,0.0352266654,0.0524145402,-0.037460234,0.0379530899,-0.0326470919,0.0648761019,-0.0407511406,0.0795188546,0.0243788119,0.0039720358,0.0262546893,0.035786666,-0.0509646758,-0.0026222861,-0.0156504139,-0.0080782101,0.0362392105,-0.0462601148,-0.0111078033,-0.0005645793,0.1058809161,-0.0215555206,0.0518302657,0.0300510433,0.1073544696,-0.0329326466,0.0078937914,-0.0168313645,-0.0149921272,-0.0176829714,0.0597438775,0.0507577918,0.0170142446,0.0025219552,-0.0439501666,-0.0169626903,-0.0791967809,-0.005780213,-0.0006400163,0.0383843593,-0.0349762663,-0.0389663763,-0.0325253494,0.0127782784,0.0142212426,-0.018797813,0.0228161756,0.0567085333,0.0119571071,0.0379447602,-0.0053982092,0.0006395217,0.016173562,-0.0038650485,-0.0020550964,0.0355369747,0.0786387622,-0.0114714727,0.0015894704,0.0897433385,-0.0515617244,-0.0059954468,0.0539149679,0.1041122824,0.0169168655,-0.0022709486,0.0170541592,0.0572417453,-0.0344310068,-0.1071681231,-0.109474659,0.0951389819,0.0053879139,0.0231029373,0.009837904,0.0282666329,-0.0186530873,-0.0213314667,0.0436606593,0.0337171778,-0.0261997599,-0.0274505969,0.0148887718,0.0354351178,-0.0311535448,0.0251151305,-0.0182833839,0.0167992115,0.0403033979,-0.0171459094,0.0217725802,-0.0309478845,0.0219722595,0.0225680768,0.028688442,-0.0578933917,-0.0151064545,0.0520354956,-0.0562502481,-0.0392422862,-0.0438294187,-0.0768844485,0.0163556021,0.011381004,-0.0920512676,0.0185996462,0.0480555072,-0.0130207893,0.0234382637,0.0378994495,0.0499375127,-0.0121863987,0.0004942074,-0.0188205354,-0.0801010057,-0.1013731807,-0.0298115369,-0.0337223038,0.0228446126,0.0363395438,0.0087714503,-0.0279852897,-0.063249819,-0.0504841805,0.0223501083,0.0681721866,-0.0485718101,0.0245635398,-0.0041000373,-0.0231751651,-0.0371782407,0.0163290128,0.0123250904,-0.0544821881,-0.0361660197,-0.004702447,0.0290140919,-0.0402026847,-0.0175922569,-0.0362090096,-0.0680020228,0.0002001914,0.0065715965,-0.0192529727,-0.0390932821,-0.0617837012,-0.1304329485,0.0008050422,0.0513778403,0.0230787639,-0.0294293165,-0.0251171216,-0.0159553774,0.0353540555,-0.0340739787,0.0331989191,-0.0973099694,0.0137824249,0.0519184805,0.0142798051,0.0290355124,0.0715774968,0.0593596809,0.0184651911,-0.0529143922,-0.0199167393,-0.0053545102,0.055130288,0.0249911007,0.0192711204,-0.0074633043,0.039777983,-0.0218263809,0.0107387351,-0.0322753862,-0.0060357633,-0.0219267923,0.0188522451,0.0152319558,-0.0504787192,-0.0319858938,0.0264150575,-0.0185170174,0.0263932776,-0.0611233637,-0.0268116929,-0.0537993535,0.0192845277,-0.0035116607,-0.0155698117,0.002550754,0.0457039922,-0.0024895275,0.0316239595,-0.0103530157,0.0621326491,0.0408355817,-0.0153847383,0.0400178991,-0.0019285249,0.0041256933,-0.0134873018,-0.0534636788,-0.0053045303,0.0067089321,-0.0152582638,-0.076499097,-0.0023153655,-0.0040742038,-0.0257149637,-0.0122706359,0.0256698579,-0.0400278419,-0.0223149825,0.0619469434,0.0322636962,0.025412919,0.0162987243,-0.0242852904,0.0713665336,0.0143091446,0.0211217869,-0.0496366471,-0.0217299182,-0.036548499,0.0102640484,-0.0325861759,0.0491061062,-0.0358483195]}

{"chunk":"Suffering from severe liver conditions, such as cirrhosis. Results InterpretationConsulting a healthcare provider for an accurate analysis of your creatinine test results is highly recommended. They can evaluate these results alongside your overall health status, symptoms, and other tests to provide a comprehensive assessment. Additionally, for a preliminary understanding, you might consider using a Lab Test Interpretation tool. This tool offers a quick and detailed explanation of your blood and urine test results, serving as a helpful initial step before you consult with a healthcare professional. This can give you valuable insights and prepare you for a more informed discussion about your health.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More\nAbnormal Levels\nHigh Creatinine Levels\nCausesElevated creatinine levels can stem from several causes, highlighting potential health issues, primarily related to kidney function:\n\nKidney Disease: Impaired kidney function is the most common cause of high creatinine levels. Diseases such as chronic kidney disease (CKD) or acute kidney injury (AKI) can hinder the kidneys' ability to filter and eliminate creatinine, leading to its accumulation in the blood. Dehydration: Inadequate fluid intake can lead to dehydration, resulting in concentrated blood and temporarily higher creatinine levels. This is because there is less water to dilute the waste products in the blood. High Protein Diet: Consuming large amounts of protein, particularly from meat, can increase creatinine production as the body metabolizes the protein. Intense Exercise: Heavy exercise can lead to increased muscle breakdown, which raises creatinine levels temporarily. SymptomsSymptoms indicating high creatinine levels are often associated with the underlying causes, particularly kidney disease, and can include:\n\nFatigue and Weakness: Decreased kidney function can lead to a buildup of toxins in the blood, causing fatigue. Swelling or Edema: Poor kidney function can cause fluid retention, leading to swelling in the legs, ankles, or feet.","book":"Creatinine: Key Insights into Normal and Abnormal Levels","embedding":[-0.0078079225,0.0590563491,-0.0290396102,-0.0743893236,0.0040307688,0.0349804685,-0.0138655109,-0.0245959815,-0.0014659489,0.0126095153,0.0206278451,0.0484485179,0.0549354926,-0.0536967888,-0.0161928162,-0.0322126448,-0.0074199587,-0.0228161123,-0.0498301685,-0.0302797593,-0.0128326081,0.0022184507,0.079474397,-0.0110211382,0.019794004,0.0183751471,-0.0075253155,0.0343636163,0.0487942733,-0.0387398712,0.0392736159,-0.039457269,0.0455173366,-0.0496058539,0.1001465693,0.0192989297,-0.0133429524,0.0292518232,0.0139287747,-0.0569614731,-0.019634936,-0.004227689,-0.028418934,0.0231381245,-0.0338354185,0.0120161967,0.0398450904,0.0771464929,-0.0136610214,0.0536860079,-0.0015249992,0.1178010404,-0.0375954509,0.0068576592,-0.0216830987,-0.0058509926,-0.0094365869,0.0657638907,0.0551096648,-0.0013929728,0.0056644096,-0.0666679591,-0.0000784573,-0.0479723997,0.0041659335,-0.0221131686,0.0348006524,-0.0495147184,-0.0226716008,0.0043540122,0.0236058198,0.0105581172,-0.0442647189,0.0140285809,0.0532613285,-0.0023701063,0.0218784716,-0.053060662,0.0113865202,0.0139820827,-0.0090700947,-0.0062278323,0.0389389396,0.13102597,-0.027301874,0.0059232851,0.060855981,-0.0227570087,-0.0242888611,0.0512826778,0.1383663565,0.0158405937,0.002592942,0.0059578954,0.0636617169,-0.0164214876,-0.0963667184,-0.1351914406,0.067804493,0.0133605078,0.0262068864,0.0066823154,0.0291933902,-0.0098586222,0.0085350033,0.0449032784,0.0439540185,-0.0291280672,-0.0528611355,0.038180273,0.0319858529,-0.0437351614,0.053584177,-0.0203282963,0.0356267504,0.0368898995,-0.0319605656,0.0125593282,-0.024441801,0.0253043622,-0.0030364674,0.0235658363,-0.0738135949,-0.0160436295,0.0593723878,-0.042582076,-0.0262349211,-0.0103429006,-0.0565051138,-0.0041552694,-0.0023858915,-0.0932761207,0.0216866322,0.0221650265,-0.0008780591,0.0517308563,0.0503574908,0.0232316926,-0.0340585299,0.0212263428,-0.0132463826,-0.0844221041,-0.0728462711,-0.0264269728,-0.0494626127,0.0101135373,-0.0092415679,0.0068650623,-0.0249999911,-0.0413364917,-0.0439686589,0.0055619283,0.0635086894,-0.0203790516,0.0260049012,-0.0078277942,-0.0289545953,-0.0524029098,0.0310762692,-0.0017281492,-0.0256050844,-0.0148296272,0.0013445795,0.00623903,-0.0425989628,-0.0368131585,-0.042561803,-0.0674863085,-0.0145512559,0.0270104706,-0.0200222917,-0.040079698,-0.0483385585,-0.1480222791,-0.0277091749,0.0162275787,0.0195564106,0.000005503,-0.0457413383,-0.0049247625,0.0666559413,-0.0173939057,0.0418878943,-0.1076367497,0.00627395,0.0780428573,-0.0119900871,0.0189356282,0.0904553011,0.0200775415,0.0030238128,-0.0230315253,-0.0186506473,-0.0143684698,0.0349613465,0.0079570077,0.0021988845,0.0197111499,0.0224562697,-0.0454074666,0.0437858514,0.0285374913,-0.0223154202,-0.0000135715,0.0243016649,0.01514774,-0.0215062387,-0.008387954,0.0091041215,-0.012569868,-0.0056269714,-0.042043183,-0.0340996496,-0.0358278826,0.0354108848,0.006218533,0.0005669912,-0.0249888524,0.0317859761,-0.0527684353,0.0138958003,-0.0125281597,-0.0086109946,0.0548199862,-0.0112310881,-0.0057917433,-0.0311178528,0.0235170443,0.0117471274,-0.037954025,0.0017321354,0.0223534573,-0.0309138522,-0.0835574791,-0.0180358831,-0.0187599789,-0.0279825497,0.0192313604,0.0268523637,-0.0215604883,-0.0377744511,0.0312252082,0.0602890365,0.0244510137,0.0125117572,-0.0320457183,0.09428785,0.029508153,0.0199173801,-0.0633102953,0.0009789841,-0.0371638834,0.0253009479,-0.0005167893,0.0428687558,-0.0177212525]}
{"chunk":"Changes in Urination: Frequent, painful, or foamy urination can occur, or, conversely, less urine output. Nausea and Vomiting: As toxins build up in the blood, it can lead to feelings of nausea or vomiting. Docus AI Symptom CheckerJust 3 simple steps to efficiently understand and manage your health symptoms online.Try Symptom Checker\nHealth ImplicationsChronic high creatinine levels can indicate serious health implications such as:\n\nKidney Failure: Persistent high levels can lead to end-stage renal disease, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Hypertension: Impaired kidney function can cause high blood pressure, which further damages the kidneys. Cardiovascular Diseases: Kidney disease can increase the risk of heart-related conditions, including heart attacks and strokes. Low Creatinine Levels\nCausesLow creatinine levels are less common and can be indicative of certain conditions:\n\nReduced Muscle Mass: Less muscle mass, as seen in elderly individuals or those with muscle-wasting diseases, can result in lower creatinine production. Severe Malnutrition: Inadequate protein intake due to eating disorders or extreme dieting can decrease creatinine levels. Liver Disease: Since creatine is synthesized in the liver, severe liver dysfunction can impair creatinine production. SymptomsSymptoms of low creatinine levels can be subtle and often related to the underlying condition rather than the low creatinine itself:\n\nGeneral Weakness: Due to reduced muscle mass or malnutrition. Weight Loss: Unintentional weight loss can accompany malnutrition or liver disease. Edema: In cases of severe liver disease, fluid may accumulate in the abdomen. Health ImplicationsLow creatinine levels can point to health issues that may need attention:\n\nMuscular Dystrophy: This group of diseases causes a loss of muscle mass, reflected in low creatinine levels. Liver Disease: Impaired liver function can lead to a variety of complications, including reduced creatinine production. Nutritional Deficiencies: Low levels might suggest dietary deficiencies that need to be addressed to improve overall health. Additional Tests Linked With CreatinineIn addition to serum creatinine tests and urine test, several other diagnostic tests are closely linked with creatinine levels and provide further insights into kidney function and overall health. Here are some key tests often conducted in conjunction with or to complement creatinine assessments:\neGFR CalculationsEstimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) is calculated using formulas that incorporate serum creatinine levels along with other patient factors such as age, sex, race, and body size. This calculation is essential for assessing kidney function and determining the stage of kidney disease. eGFR provides a more comprehensive view of kidney health than creatinine levels alone. Creatinine Clearance TestThe Creatinine Clearance Test is another critical diagnostic tool used to assess kidney function. It measures the rate at which creatinine is cleared from the blood by the kidneys, providing insight into how well the kidneys are filtering and eliminating this waste product. This test involves a combination of a blood test and a 24-hour urine collection to accurately determine the creatinine clearance rate. BUN\/Creatinine RatioThe BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)\/creatinine ratio is used to evaluate kidney function and help diagnose kidney conditions. This ratio compares the levels of blood urea nitrogen to creatinine in the blood and can indicate conditions such as dehydration, kidney disease, or obstructive uropathy. A higher or lower than normal ratio can provide additional clues about underlying health issues beyond what creatinine levels alone can reveal. UrinalysisA comprehensive urinalysis includes tests for the presence of proteins, blood, and other substances in the urine. It helps detect conditions that may not affect creatinine levels directly but indicate kidney or urinary tract issues. Cystatin CCystatin C is a protein that, like creatinine, is produced throughout the body at a constant rate and cleared by the kidneys. It is sometimes measured to provide an alternative or additional marker of kidney function, especially in cases where creatinine measurements might be misleading (e.g., for individuals with unusually high or low muscle mass). Imaging TestsImaging techniques such as ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRIs can be used to visually assess the kidneys for structural abnormalities that might affect their function. These tests can provide context for abnormal creatinine levels and help identify potential causes of kidney impairment. Kidney BiopsyIn some cases, a kidney biopsy may be necessary to determine the cause of abnormal kidney function. This invasive procedure involves taking a small sample of kidney tissue for microscopic examination. It can help diagnose the type of kidney disease affecting creatinine levels and guide treatment decisions. Managing and Improving Creatinine Levels\nDietary ChangesAdjusting your diet can help manage and potentially improve your creatinine levels:\n\nReduce Protein Intake: Especially red meat, which can increase creatinine levels due to its high creatine content. Increase Fiber Intake: Fiber-rich foods help improve overall kidney function by reducing the stress on the kidneys. Incorporate Fruits: Certain fruits may help lower creatinine levels. These fruits are high in antioxidants and fiber, supporting detoxification processes and kidney function. Stay Hydrated: Adequate hydration helps the kidneys function efficiently and aids in the excretion of waste products, including creatinine. Limit Salt Intake: Excessive salt can increase blood pressure and put additional strain on the kidneys. Lifestyle ChangesIn addition to dietary adjustments, making certain lifestyle changes can also help maintain healthy creatinine levels:\n\nRegular Exercise: Engaging in moderate exercise helps maintain overall health and muscle mass, but avoid excessive exercise which can raise creatinine levels. Avoid NSAIDs: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce kidney function and increase creatinine levels if used frequently. Monitor Blood Pressure: High blood pressure can damage the kidneys over time, so managing blood pressure is crucial for maintaining good kidney health. Regular Check-ups: Routine health checks, including kidney function tests, can help catch any abnormalities early. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat Is Creatinine?Creatinine is a waste product produced from the normal breakdown of muscle tissue. It is typically filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and excreted in urine. Monitoring creatinine levels is crucial because it helps assess the functioning of the kidneys and can indicate renal health or problems.What Are Normal Creatinine Levels?Normal creatinine levels vary depending on age, gender, and muscle mass but generally fall within these ranges: for adult men, 0.74 to 1.35 mg\/dL (65.4 to 119.3 micromoles\/L); for adult women, 0.59 to 1.04 mg\/dL (52.2 to 91.9 micromoles\/L). These levels can differ based on the methods and standards used by different laboratories.When Should I Be Concerned About My Creatinine Levels?You should consult a healthcare provider if your creatinine levels are consistently outside the normal range, as this could indicate a potential kidney problem. Signs of concern include a sudden increase in creatinine levels, which might suggest acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease if levels remain elevated over time.Have more questions?Ask AI Doctor\n\n\n","book":"Creatinine: Key Insights into Normal and Abnormal Levels","embedding":[0.0011103408,0.0502506681,-0.0395070575,-0.0575520694,0.0187814739,0.0255077835,-0.0273693241,-0.0244596042,0.0028010695,-0.010900598,0.0228366088,0.061872106,0.0645225942,-0.0274846889,-0.0516947545,-0.0509564988,0.0040197428,-0.041251272,-0.0773716122,-0.0279795174,0.0255645216,0.0079670977,0.0629258081,-0.0300624631,0.0118034724,-0.0023668713,0.0051765963,0.0364343859,0.0551897101,-0.0202234555,0.0631031394,-0.0395462178,0.0701560676,-0.0414668806,0.086766921,0.0466601849,0.0099515421,0.0406024754,0.0256964508,-0.0391246937,-0.0151152471,-0.0253728349,0.0052749128,0.0320328102,-0.0318491235,0.0147981988,0.0279225875,0.1067195535,-0.0056747003,0.0545982495,0.0073398445,0.0918415487,-0.0124006821,-0.0059873331,-0.0309691802,-0.0227021798,-0.0337120518,0.0727992207,0.0595666803,0.0066354843,-0.0074758404,-0.064570725,-0.0439142287,-0.0572853424,-0.0008664062,-0.0165281557,0.0346746109,-0.0297556054,-0.0359423682,-0.0393306874,0.002862284,0.0184228625,-0.0251138937,0.0288737025,0.0653496608,0.0047868434,0.0546077378,-0.0239091925,-0.0094490247,-0.0038155483,-0.0210515186,0.0087982873,0.0475161225,0.1000458524,-0.0199154168,0.0015796071,0.0477185622,-0.042947866,-0.0240222439,0.0280173868,0.1049041748,0.0203995593,0.0060024215,0.0191490948,0.0707906038,-0.0262170006,-0.0939066112,-0.0973456278,0.0772768036,0.0258892886,0.0229103677,-0.0018317292,0.0273852628,-0.0378510505,0.0119230412,0.0597877204,0.0603824668,-0.0276908539,-0.0397140533,0.0538690388,0.0320927836,-0.0084658535,0.0412118584,-0.0030981661,0.0115557052,0.0422102697,-0.0241218023,0.0193785764,-0.0194267891,0.0253895633,0.0156507827,0.0325586908,-0.0659399256,-0.0027281311,0.0755935386,-0.0481369421,-0.0402455218,-0.0247314703,-0.0678126812,0.0086976588,0.0153300278,-0.0865894333,0.0283211861,0.0105257863,0.0193425771,0.0264835041,0.0340062566,0.0180760119,-0.0318772383,0.0152797988,-0.0231238455,-0.0917440355,-0.0752758384,-0.0442034975,-0.0487660766,0.0284911599,0.0124070896,0.0139584914,0.0024083417,-0.0559163876,-0.04878328,0.0223838612,0.0555399209,-0.0570796356,0.0146344742,0.0090984059,-0.0291166753,-0.0590189956,0.0364337601,-0.0119796935,-0.0315546133,-0.0239480417,-0.008731259,0.0235759709,-0.0331314988,-0.0352647863,-0.0393835492,-0.0855209008,0.0084074307,0.0125467628,-0.0047253934,-0.0242049992,-0.0804275125,-0.1343492419,-0.0182471313,0.0389563479,0.0492938347,-0.0222786982,-0.0485359021,0.0011768141,0.0575854927,-0.0148517182,0.0380754508,-0.0911055654,0.0177926999,0.0521525331,0.0193051044,0.0359480977,0.0744518787,0.0309419669,-0.0143023469,-0.0523267575,-0.0232690927,-0.0089284219,0.0319043919,0.0253577754,0.0086659361,-0.0151527515,0.0245073382,-0.0166527927,0.0049456679,-0.0043218937,-0.0052238749,-0.0285537224,0.0309718866,-0.005115903,-0.0106977932,-0.0099325953,0.0038155473,-0.0268591326,0.0046269177,-0.0639765635,-0.046902433,-0.0461761504,0.0223157853,0.0057274136,-0.0189098287,-0.0003295208,0.0604281835,-0.0392435491,0.0057891216,-0.0180425514,0.031643074,0.0549305975,-0.0146313859,0.0083386628,-0.0111804018,0.0210012943,-0.0050520813,-0.043027427,-0.0096568661,0.0139466608,-0.0346904509,-0.0777884275,-0.015055432,-0.0125707369,-0.0189992804,0.0097987503,0.0078724381,-0.0257104635,-0.0411195196,0.0697079301,0.0715471506,0.0260701384,0.0094719967,-0.032561291,0.0636991337,0.0308999214,0.0089217601,-0.0620319508,-0.0069372617,-0.0251504574,0.0050548692,-0.0098299086,0.0836636573,-0.0309091154]}

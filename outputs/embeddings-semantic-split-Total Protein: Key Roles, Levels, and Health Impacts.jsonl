{"chunk":"Total protein levels in the blood can reveal important information about liver and kidney health, nutrition, and immune function. Managing abnormal levels is crucial to prevent complications related to dehydration, chronic diseases, or malnutrition.ContentsWhat Is Total Protein?When Is Total Protein Testing Recommended?How Is Total Protein Testing Conducted?What Are the Normal Total Protein Levels?What Do Abnormal Total Protein Levels Mean? What Is Total Protein?Total protein is a measure of the overall amount of protein present in your blood. Proteins are essential for many functions in the body, such as building tissues, transporting substances, and fighting infections. The two main types of protein measured are albumin and globulin. Albumin helps transport hormones and nutrients, while globulin plays a key role in the immune system. Checking total protein levels is often used to help diagnose various diseases or conditions, particularly those related to the liver, kidneys, or immune system.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More\nWhen Is Total Protein Testing Recommended?Total protein testing is commonly used to monitor general health and detect certain conditions. It may be recommended in the following cases:\n\nTo check liver or kidney function\nWhen there is difficulty urinating or unexplained swelling in the body\nTo identify the cause of fluid buildup in the lungs, which may cause shortness of breath\nWhen an infection or chronic inflammation is suspected\nTo investigate blood disorders, such as certain types of cancer affecting the blood\n\nHow Is Total Protein Testing Conducted?Total protein is measured through a blood test, which is part of several broader tests, such as a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) or a basic metabolic panel (BMP). During the test, a small blood sample is taken from a vein in your arm and sent to a laboratory for analysis.","book":"Total Protein: Key Roles, Levels, and Health Impacts","embedding":[0.008828246,0.0406113677,-0.0049126754,-0.0620038845,0.0041000484,0.024694277,0.0100328596,0.0482219905,-0.013440514,0.0123243397,0.0233903434,0.0063201776,0.0300961435,-0.0261772051,-0.0209121779,-0.0720775947,-0.0417363308,-0.0547074489,-0.0843655914,-0.0692061558,-0.0062420913,-0.0155175412,0.0393599644,0.0138715655,0.0120540634,-0.02847795,-0.0581673086,0.0273683276,0.0057118614,-0.0721616223,0.0426943824,-0.0704419315,0.0319171883,-0.0399107747,0.0738959312,-0.0103303576,0.0351623744,-0.0077525321,0.0508669913,-0.0183942206,0.0283577889,-0.0190527029,-0.0516493358,0.0248316899,-0.0532991439,-0.0068557928,0.0266262982,0.0866579339,-0.0380201973,0.0237098541,0.0223720502,0.0530868731,-0.0840437263,0.0261699334,-0.0477473922,-0.0255545899,0.0069793849,0.0129878242,0.0437386632,0.0065412694,0.0016461472,-0.0417296402,0.0135390479,-0.0368420109,-0.0104427598,0.0253146775,0.0131357703,-0.0235146135,-0.0571070947,-0.0253242161,0.0246741939,0.0048613283,-0.0496933162,0.0297386423,0.0164100919,0.0247453153,0.0114241503,-0.024359988,-0.0016889635,-0.0185631383,-0.0275726654,-0.0195202641,0.0822889358,0.1122485474,-0.0351758339,-0.0228176992,0.0767312422,-0.0459449776,-0.0048766932,0.0645589083,0.1571719795,-0.0143844709,0.0030238889,0.045207724,0.0768213347,-0.0153927626,-0.1166606173,-0.089398481,0.0622059815,0.0337748714,0.0196065679,0.0046239183,0.0178905334,-0.0525428094,0.0073293671,-0.0044447314,0.0409813821,-0.0218864139,0.0103113567,-0.0062076873,0.0675158203,-0.059461128,0.0030560372,-0.0024779656,0.0125912176,-0.0006480018,-0.0288122222,0.0139296548,-0.0023511159,0.016646754,0.0085982047,0.0208026059,0.0146408435,0.0127806989,0.0483400561,-0.0085867243,-0.0584236458,-0.0331376232,-0.0614478104,-0.0106691187,0.0029273569,-0.0775196478,0.0437026769,0.0299518518,-0.0036257443,0.0388362817,0.0685212538,0.049221728,-0.0465872213,0.0493918583,-0.0152860619,-0.0675611719,-0.074192144,0.0092215668,-0.00775947,0.0119013898,0.0311837755,0.0332127661,-0.0409180485,-0.0684592649,-0.0227294769,-0.016204711,0.0593112633,-0.0319722556,0.0063759834,0.0308972504,0.0093314257,-0.050207179,0.0574880503,0.0057893549,-0.0171319041,-0.0843590274,0.0043933196,0.0685110688,-0.0495648421,-0.0296443887,-0.0540524907,-0.0316706188,0.0073141423,-0.0058122226,0.0278489366,-0.0382504836,-0.0094033657,-0.1576001644,0.0091179516,0.0103635089,-0.0093409233,-0.0518094487,-0.0111220609,0.0107814241,0.0409710407,-0.0032445993,0.0049854876,-0.1047846377,0.013169474,0.0550619699,0.0117746871,0.0253992844,0.078645058,0.0130850738,0.0031183485,-0.0035385925,0.0055654687,0.0072639501,0.0096423952,0.0561281964,0.0014987686,-0.0100706015,0.0362390243,-0.0603263676,0.0272168852,-0.0313187577,0.031481348,-0.0142432693,-0.0098962998,0.0184894186,-0.0243754983,-0.0109350886,0.020647008,-0.0114798788,-0.0016516027,-0.0635744408,-0.0276463851,-0.0378431864,0.0141846826,0.0173211023,-0.0071645239,0.0003484965,0.0144556081,0.0035396589,-0.0076081716,0.0033943825,-0.0228915643,0.0251375549,0.0092500877,0.0593995154,-0.0729214326,-0.0419877209,0.0443288423,-0.0058263498,-0.0029170827,0.0261351913,0.0130003383,-0.0650365353,0.0075013232,0.0079213586,-0.0156168258,-0.0111799547,0.0244040675,-0.0173645671,0.0090970928,0.0412849151,0.0358427316,0.032283023,0.0173630938,-0.0271846317,0.0749295354,0.0115151545,-0.0170256961,-0.0479016528,-0.0141769424,-0.0141352639,0.0354810432,-0.0170860961,0.0082274554,-0.0117273647]}

{"chunk":"Follow medical advice: For managing chronic conditions, blood disorders, or autoimmune diseases. Total Protein Low LevelsLow total protein levels can indicate that the body is not getting enough protein or that there are problems with protein absorption or loss. Possible causes include:\n\nMalnutrition: A diet lacking in sufficient protein can result in low total protein levels. Liver or kidney diseases: These organs are responsible for producing and filtering proteins. Damage or disease can lead to lower protein levels. Chronic illnesses: Conditions like Crohn\u2019s disease or celiac disease can interfere with protein absorption. Post-surgical recovery: After surgery, the body may need time to restore normal protein levels. Recommendations\nImprove diet: Eat more protein-rich foods such as lean meats, beans, and dairy products. Manage chronic diseases: Work with your healthcare provider to treat conditions affecting protein absorption. Monitor liver and kidney health: Follow up with regular check-ups to ensure these organs are functioning properly. Which Specialist Should You Consult?If your total protein levels are abnormal, you may need to consult different specialists depending on the underlying cause.

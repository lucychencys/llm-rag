{"chunk":"Blood Differential\nWhat is a Blood Differential Test? A blood differential test measures the amount of each type of white blood cell (WBC) that you have in your body. White blood cells (leukocytes) are part of your immune system, a network of cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect you from infection. There are five different types of white blood cells:\n\nNeutrophils are the most common type of white blood cell. They are your body's main defense against infection when bacteria, viruses, or other germs enter your body. Lymphocytes include two main types of white blood cells: B cells and T cells. B cells fight off invading viruses, bacteria, or toxins. Certain T cells can target and destroy your body's own cells, such as cancer cells and cells that have been infected by viruses. Monocytes kill bacteria, viruses, and other germs that may make you sick. They also boost your body's immune response and clear away dead cells. Eosinophils defend against parasites and infections. They are also involved in allergies and help control inflammation (swelling and redness). Basophils release enzymes during allergic reactions and asthma attacks. However, your test results may have more than five numbers.","book":"Blood Differential","embedding":[0.0105617112,0.0236982871,-0.0065710424,-0.0413837768,-0.0188611448,-0.0074950932,-0.0009590231,0.070907943,-0.0540176518,0.055691652,-0.0034537145,-0.0151738916,0.0069363033,-0.0586115234,0.0246587172,-0.0904285386,0.0053669843,-0.0404071063,-0.110506773,-0.071217373,0.0151111037,-0.0105305407,0.0394371077,-0.0362276062,-0.0329337865,-0.0002588683,-0.0095867645,-0.0306639355,-0.0465787277,-0.0016833066,0.0880955011,-0.0226244237,0.0370835327,-0.0203992985,0.0064557916,-0.0348741263,0.0152631365,-0.0165456664,0.0275814161,-0.0138124432,0.0292619765,-0.0333872251,-0.0431893133,0.0152803659,-0.0148513252,-0.0360378623,0.0425308235,0.0618638843,-0.0297047216,0.0047403486,-0.0066447416,0.034051273,-0.0766401738,0.0769119114,0.0208297838,-0.0573886037,0.0106347539,0.0045181597,0.0208365209,0.0030431917,-0.0451014563,-0.0003579563,-0.0102315452,-0.0326111279,-0.0222781394,0.0341121666,-0.0335407555,-0.0193989202,-0.0457412153,0.0137117691,0.0488358885,-0.0097516021,-0.0219874512,0.0320135243,0.0034722709,-0.0059636999,0.0258434229,0.0021426082,-0.0159804653,0.0784571171,-0.0167387854,-0.0289882515,0.0943355784,0.0775718018,0.0053438125,0.0480012037,0.0419134088,-0.0183787011,0.0506730713,0.0598663464,0.08640071,0.0542042442,-0.0418776833,0.0220785197,0.0774862543,-0.0554679073,-0.0991204903,-0.1225499287,0.1138537303,0.0578933507,-0.0473284759,-0.0217964966,0.0017528158,-0.0154141076,0.0283814259,0.0536640026,0.0611767396,-0.0237176884,-0.0342087746,-0.0019789247,0.0331013501,-0.0204425063,0.0242175478,0.0258144587,0.0613217913,0.0126879364,-0.0217278525,-0.0105319712,-0.000670656,0.0317083821,0.0021471474,0.0263324063,-0.0357738733,0.0266156048,0.0040598172,-0.0114928763,-0.0519735962,-0.0323539451,-0.0130041111,0.0023708434,0.0461084209,-0.0816316903,0.0131998798,0.0567174107,-0.0448176637,-0.0206328165,0.0653271526,0.0166179668,-0.0297087729,0.037313059,0.0135012539,-0.0050488263,-0.0751892775,0.026930077,0.010879443,-0.0317909494,0.0423344672,0.0266195685,-0.015219898,-0.0577437729,0.0113052716,-0.0074092024,0.0389681794,-0.0070642428,0.0250905305,0.0215957686,0.0405008905,-0.00306201,0.0973035023,-0.016847102,0.0194105431,-0.0486809462,0.0002805059,0.0247315019,-0.0457828343,0.0014309981,0.0207129605,-0.0642492324,-0.0107152034,-0.0490414426,0.0057588643,-0.0204376448,-0.0722422004,-0.112463966,-0.0100764949,-0.0102022858,0.0280997083,-0.0752002522,0.062739253,-0.0043276246,0.0537367016,0.0254108086,-0.0050146608,-0.1245724857,0.0119197555,0.0539757311,0.0351369306,0.030114051,0.0754668117,0.1010512784,-0.010066391,0.0012999355,0.0253086071,-0.0321652777,-0.0061387126,0.0097007062,0.0313087888,0.0148010626,-0.0093534496,-0.0687981024,0.0271640476,-0.025413556,-0.0102111008,0.0099160783,-0.0004735504,0.0390826128,-0.0064887144,-0.0270001329,0.0459230617,0.0422143154,0.0228379574,-0.0438506342,0.0097786188,-0.0170938801,-0.0039141723,-0.0057464521,0.0308473315,-0.0210454222,0.0061673159,-0.003843464,0.029048305,0.0044217492,0.0096599329,0.0352291502,0.009636349,0.0145460619,-0.0543518662,0.0321244076,0.0287698302,-0.06198043,-0.0429440998,0.0169017352,0.0193269774,-0.0235307366,0.0205578562,-0.0229215287,0.0080327056,-0.0348541811,-0.0014276397,-0.0625006631,-0.0039033557,0.0591665469,0.0633820221,0.0063254754,0.0510211289,-0.0087464787,0.0584362671,0.0253363736,-0.0146033019,-0.0287824012,0.0369199365,-0.0363635048,-0.0030604505,-0.0281145256,-0.0333381929,0.012136695]}

{"chunk":"Diagnose a medical condition when you have symptoms. For example, if you are feeling unusually tired or weak, or have unexplained bruising or other symptoms, this test may help uncover the cause. Keep track of an existing blood disorder or related condition. What happens during a blood differential test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial.

{"chunk":"What do the results mean? There are many reasons your blood differential test results may be higher or lower than normal. For example, a high white blood cell count may mean you have an infection, an immune disorder, leukemia, or an allergic reaction. A low count may be caused by bone marrow problems, reactions to medicines, or cancer. But abnormal results don't always mean you have a condition that needs medical treatment. Factors such as exercise, diet, alcohol level, medicines, and even a woman's menstrual period can affect the results. If your results seem abnormal, your provider may order more specific tests to help figure out the cause. To learn what your results mean, talk with your provider. Learn more about laboratory tests, reference ranges, and understanding results. Is there anything else I need to know about a blood differential test? Use of certain steroids may increase your white blood cell count, which can lead to an abnormal result in your blood differential test.","book":"Blood Differential","embedding":[0.0172206312,-0.003169168,-0.0523141325,-0.0354022197,-0.0507026203,0.0157401506,0.0191846024,0.0408037566,-0.0279626194,0.0321292318,0.015020757,-0.0352430791,0.0216630585,-0.0970604643,-0.0155658834,-0.0592326,0.0096626161,-0.03729349,-0.0885665193,-0.0591001734,0.0111393556,-0.0349044427,0.0340883024,0.0129400529,-0.0357980952,0.024296917,-0.0303392932,-0.0316336155,-0.0501443706,-0.0435671248,0.051157508,-0.0290507022,0.0375193022,-0.0091792988,0.0152239958,-0.0148621062,-0.0185712427,0.0044355583,0.0013749405,-0.0332442485,-0.0052432162,-0.0085600959,-0.024649173,0.0022329753,0.0121184802,-0.0096295653,0.0614953525,0.0557953306,-0.0229701865,0.0017485252,-0.005885323,0.0535135195,-0.0877270326,0.0550916567,0.0108796759,-0.0269229021,0.0197973438,0.0385576226,0.0201344471,-0.0065554869,-0.0272791069,0.0159012116,0.010755769,-0.0397632644,0.0089296121,-0.00515923,-0.0233690627,-0.0472708084,-0.0343525484,0.0062612598,0.0422042497,-0.0182796698,-0.0080911135,0.0108426632,0.0468310378,-0.0136802122,0.0167134255,-0.0134864971,-0.0226603989,0.0717011169,0.0205037799,-0.0273077711,0.0730501115,0.0907470956,0.0035630616,0.043787282,0.0356212668,0.0100695845,0.0308115575,0.0250965841,0.0975973085,0.031061206,-0.0277915373,0.0228748359,0.077297993,-0.0425733328,-0.0895817652,-0.1170362458,0.0868505165,0.0626145527,-0.0230179373,-0.0291465614,0.0132107465,-0.016195083,0.0504931994,0.0258370005,0.0434389636,-0.0286485124,-0.0562494323,0.0015011604,0.0414450876,-0.0157374628,0.040892534,0.0166607518,0.0605129488,0.0153660383,-0.010130994,0.0186999403,0.0108299423,-0.0009908855,0.0096162716,0.0415708646,-0.0538840592,-0.0004599263,-0.0113617666,-0.0379484817,-0.0308710188,-0.0332577825,-0.0181126017,-0.0450682789,0.0286094826,-0.1114985719,0.0446621478,0.0484834313,-0.0426951237,-0.0039082039,0.0337947048,0.0250562727,-0.0454574637,0.0210179929,-0.0135848792,-0.0317735113,-0.0869388133,-0.0157644134,-0.0274526346,-0.0419176929,-0.0005850266,0.038778808,-0.0330437981,-0.0156160342,-0.0406485014,-0.0153914625,0.0529262163,-0.0173070189,0.030237915,0.0251690876,0.0064144162,0.0054559885,0.0883691311,-0.0201008618,0.0035882816,-0.0479318649,0.0393288359,0.0027797814,-0.0473757312,-0.0061893407,0.0067277099,-0.0868503824,0.0026556402,-0.0342412777,-0.0017614535,-0.0299288258,-0.100815244,-0.1356934011,-0.0088452511,-0.0267741084,0.0172183271,-0.0260310788,0.0144760497,-0.0312165674,0.0607481115,0.0177830178,0.0053150007,-0.1238546968,-0.006124103,0.0630394444,-0.0148544153,0.0033752725,0.1115311608,0.0690117627,-0.001882673,0.0210669953,-0.0074178781,-0.0248650871,-0.0039200657,0.002807118,0.0174299031,0.0361022875,-0.0180187672,-0.0607871115,0.0583844148,0.0141098406,-0.0374659449,0.002289905,-0.0111793978,0.066092886,-0.0024438724,-0.0267976057,0.0090389019,0.0562550388,0.00370756,-0.0328418426,-0.037577007,-0.0088126427,0.0046806615,0.0120250685,0.0118995328,-0.0444680043,0.0092045888,-0.0199856814,-0.0110191712,0.0066021462,0.0113891289,0.0340612121,-0.0023081924,0.0057680202,-0.0702943131,0.0489976853,0.0128082875,-0.0319407284,-0.0202714596,0.0402426533,-0.0071092662,-0.0452278145,0.0181841776,-0.0364506394,-0.0004286544,-0.0278939959,0.0229227897,-0.0646059811,-0.0151293827,0.0271868985,0.0766219571,0.03482382,0.0720456466,-0.0407959446,0.0680284724,0.0266252123,-0.0179087929,-0.0297283716,0.023883367,-0.0250499584,-0.0043616663,0.0017239277,-0.043156337,0.0378184393]}

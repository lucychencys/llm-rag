{"chunk":"Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) is an enzyme that helps evaluate liver, heart, and muscle health. High AST levels can be caused by liver disease, heart conditions, or intense physical activity. Managing AST levels is crucial for maintaining organ health and preventing further complications.ContentsWhat Is AST?When Is AST Testing Recommended?How Is AST Testing Conducted?What Are the Normal AST Levels?What Do Abnormal AST Levels Mean? What Is AST?AST, or Aspartate Aminotransferase, is an enzyme found in various organs of the body, particularly in the liver, heart, muscles, and kidneys. Its primary function is to help with the metabolism of amino acids, which are essential for energy production and other vital processes. When cells in these organs are damaged or injured, AST is released into the bloodstream. This makes AST a valuable biomarker in diagnosing and monitoring certain health conditions, particularly those related to the liver and heart. Doctors often order AST tests to assess the health of these organs and detect diseases like liver damage or heart disease. AST testing is particularly useful for:\n\nEvaluating liver function and identifying conditions like hepatitis or cirrhosis. Diagnosing heart problems such as heart attacks. Monitoring the progress of certain treatments, especially those that affect the liver. When Is AST Testing Recommended?AST testing is prescribed in various situations where doctors need to assess the health of the liver, heart, or muscles. It can be a routine part of health checkups or requested when symptoms suggest something might be wrong with these organs. Here are common situations when an AST test might be recommended:\n\nAs part of a preventive health examination. If a person experiences pain or discomfort in the chest area.","book":"AST Blood Test: Levels, Health Risks and Key Insights","embedding":[0.0077622761,0.0133235268,-0.0109435981,-0.0664506927,0.0131343957,0.0447882451,-0.0022997621,0.0396858118,0.0023585239,0.0035338223,-0.0208226219,0.0151887452,0.0224321559,0.0157717187,-0.0270489398,-0.0288981143,-0.0400935858,0.0047732978,-0.0796059966,-0.0507208668,0.0005027378,-0.0006514932,0.0111669982,-0.0235002153,0.0116307242,0.0156046562,-0.0474973656,0.0167274289,-0.0205245335,-0.028570395,0.0023934531,-0.0660312474,0.0568581522,-0.0079667224,0.0490155965,-0.0023213418,0.0006331236,0.0399303734,0.0159186553,-0.0596165098,0.0191820282,0.0196603686,-0.0589764193,0.0315145925,-0.0462856814,-0.0365326032,0.0535779782,0.0533360131,-0.0501476675,-0.0082558468,0.0034920776,0.0493975505,-0.0632203743,0.029263366,-0.0377118997,-0.0925524086,0.0265819747,-0.0105812186,0.0257359557,-0.0098440181,-0.0303263068,-0.0265053995,-0.0430623367,-0.045492813,-0.0185862575,-0.0289710891,0.0299904309,-0.0290908981,-0.0136024076,-0.0141743226,-0.0211191755,-0.0174650028,-0.0210750252,0.0092998734,0.0367257595,0.001356767,-0.0208068956,0.0319508687,0.0014465847,0.0270692743,-0.0427972041,-0.0552470721,0.0207778215,0.0793921798,0.0194027368,-0.0478155129,0.0363051072,-0.0512177646,-0.0134018622,0.056797374,0.0903850421,0.0018013626,0.0064496291,0.0619911142,0.0304114353,-0.025201384,-0.0671106353,-0.1153065935,0.0705417097,0.0423758365,-0.0080455728,-0.0117798867,0.0199282113,-0.0024663648,-0.0020807446,0.0033392382,0.0615235195,-0.0181495454,-0.0056500612,-0.0267154612,0.0194475949,-0.019130215,0.0234344434,-0.0069999504,0.0113795735,0.0275957491,0.0050200173,0.0321900845,0.0208245087,0.0157233458,0.0217552129,0.0489538424,-0.0126105109,0.0215183962,0.0596316978,0.0484158173,-0.0337370671,-0.002107936,-0.0635219961,0.0515869707,-0.0199716445,-0.1001774594,0.010191666,-0.0143425437,-0.0118613383,-0.0211669896,0.0677322745,0.0219980683,-0.0402138159,0.0289363172,-0.0184191093,-0.0412118845,-0.1079373881,-0.008334402,-0.0320409834,-0.0237950291,0.0589331202,-0.0380358621,0.0041453554,-0.0971650034,-0.0264633354,-0.018495854,0.0240716655,-0.0045065717,0.0349313356,-0.0287160501,0.0551810972,-0.0829264969,0.0200588554,-0.039912127,0.0112227099,-0.0518434569,0.0338031985,0.0469734408,-0.0425876081,-0.0043302309,-0.0041634822,-0.0297027528,-0.0354445018,-0.0155969793,-0.0620894693,0.0067335945,-0.0184908621,-0.1534738094,0.0218656566,-0.0172977392,-0.058605697,-0.0242675822,0.0059178914,0.0216744654,0.0710717887,0.0088624591,0.0074823857,-0.1061339527,0.0372789577,0.0309691783,0.0415111668,0.0313026384,0.0430457443,0.0363866165,-0.0286463499,-0.0072817006,0.0186190046,0.0165040419,0.0370804146,0.070163928,0.0170827564,0.0487915762,0.0375539213,-0.0538159534,0.0007120977,-0.0106659727,0.044082433,0.0240902677,-0.004525579,0.0136367362,0.0102875475,-0.0679841712,0.017108921,0.0078638159,0.0279677939,0.0097684255,-0.0525121987,-0.0507440083,-0.0147594949,-0.0136291329,-0.0333435796,0.0205393527,0.0559602194,-0.0245987102,0.0203077886,-0.0165315736,0.0205285475,0.0704915151,0.0567659512,0.0231305044,-0.0464980789,-0.0103444876,0.0119280694,-0.0102643315,-0.0096363835,-0.0028082959,-0.002015091,-0.0340151899,-0.0598567873,-0.0390968062,-0.0091218874,-0.0095137013,0.0344939269,-0.0008378628,0.0244522672,0.0074083153,0.0542511009,0.0113464184,0.021969527,-0.029828012,0.1051958799,0.0272376314,0.0018028859,-0.0526329838,0.0073425793,-0.0108102681,0.0137915546,-0.033445403,0.0045953076,-0.037272092]}

{"chunk":"In cases of excessive alcohol consumption or suspected liver damage. How Is AST Testing Conducted?AST levels are typically measured through a blood test. A healthcare professional will draw a small sample of blood, usually from a vein in your arm, to analyze the levels of AST in the serum. The test is often part of broader blood panels such as:\n\nComprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): A test that checks for various markers related to liver and kidney function, including AST. Liver Function Test (LFT): Specifically focused on evaluating the health of the liver by measuring enzymes like AST and ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase). Special Preparations for AST Testing:\n\nFasting: Do not eat for 8 hours before the test (drinking water is allowed). Alcohol: Avoid alcohol consumption for at least 24 hours before the test, as it can affect liver enzyme levels.","book":"AST Blood Test: Levels, Health Risks and Key Insights","embedding":[0.0127277067,0.0211611204,-0.0321957767,-0.0562835671,0.0258051641,0.0142205358,0.0227954108,0.0931301117,-0.0033319974,0.0158585813,-0.0111117065,-0.0096893189,0.013083159,0.0052708024,-0.0159146134,-0.0061718794,-0.0595868081,0.0220103245,-0.1005728096,-0.0740629882,0.013071185,-0.0103100743,0.0166218281,-0.0358730368,0.0219444633,0.0327620022,-0.0373461209,0.0294383764,-0.0198512208,-0.021428436,-0.0002905746,-0.0691672117,0.0513046756,-0.0087431334,0.0579249561,0.046415545,-0.0016288757,0.0096578039,0.0376309976,-0.058687672,0.0081605399,0.0280848965,-0.0630654916,0.051559817,-0.0607401654,-0.0388262831,0.009871453,0.0499875993,-0.0186003614,-0.0238388125,-0.0116895866,0.0466661863,-0.0571544878,0.0142652215,-0.0348382704,-0.0510563254,0.0490898378,-0.0320431143,0.0579186566,-0.0293937735,-0.0066390918,-0.013283656,-0.0173785985,-0.0326824188,-0.0215831045,-0.0511897057,0.0410895236,-0.0152181908,-0.0111434413,-0.0190396626,0.0078322198,-0.0070856828,-0.0197324604,0.0078785699,0.0346290655,0.0035659401,-0.001105408,0.0383665301,0.0025456497,0.0392445885,-0.0318898745,-0.0401774868,0.0115276873,0.0890739337,0.0028314921,-0.0606254786,0.0570747368,-0.0590231419,0.0155341364,0.0441294573,0.0856391639,0.0181990154,0.0044698385,0.0605714172,0.0514427312,-0.0623826645,-0.0904483348,-0.1187010631,0.0725416839,0.0236724056,-0.0009821024,-0.0110879857,0.0235178806,0.0157508403,0.0055761863,-0.0044637504,0.044713147,-0.0066045001,-0.0073978519,-0.0097417403,0.0334241502,-0.0281744152,0.0230108351,-0.005351956,-0.0096081132,0.0215111747,-0.0029513338,0.040846765,0.0127474414,0.0081592491,0.0138402749,0.0472073667,-0.0094769103,0.0151258782,0.0333337337,0.0481302962,-0.0326572545,0.0158295929,-0.0443311743,0.018466074,0.0018355671,-0.0927435681,0.0256773308,0.0292766467,-0.0504469648,-0.0209465493,0.0667014271,0.0217485335,-0.037956696,0.0563692078,-0.0110909669,-0.0216790047,-0.1204192489,-0.0166757777,-0.0453979634,-0.0140521368,0.0494262837,-0.0225334652,-0.0159465242,-0.0799168274,-0.0410995744,-0.0314463526,0.0099897552,-0.0249587931,0.0297751743,-0.0216074195,0.0555645898,-0.0639303476,0.0355935656,-0.0396269225,0.0179423392,-0.0825957283,0.0533037186,0.0460057184,-0.0619790442,-0.0174549911,0.0141487559,-0.0289286282,-0.0100617735,-0.0244570859,-0.0443403721,-0.0159453582,-0.0066838996,-0.1698601693,0.0460666418,-0.0085746152,-0.0581999868,-0.0208086632,0.040039815,0.0322644077,0.0802551657,0.0183416773,0.018206412,-0.0783121064,0.0324194878,0.0603131875,0.059382014,0.0425175317,0.0306337439,0.0258975532,-0.010279703,-0.0207940508,0.0066912454,-0.0023100874,0.0090733794,0.0890833363,-0.0002980477,0.0368985534,0.0355073437,-0.0794901401,0.0229684357,0.0018519608,0.0255823974,0.0403236113,0.0184458438,0.0253487676,0.0109671354,-0.0601355955,0.0223296322,0.0048987772,0.0438862853,0.0061791083,-0.0508657619,-0.0369616002,0.0087735448,-0.0349249393,-0.0241719335,0.0224563014,0.0484203808,-0.0063997102,0.0290186536,-0.0025541731,0.0330227613,0.0715034753,0.0412356444,0.0736691281,-0.056213595,-0.023036344,0.0288611799,-0.0229763687,-0.0204121657,0.0054551619,0.0133155081,-0.0327932499,-0.0480456725,-0.050285738,-0.0296289418,0.0042825337,0.0399473198,-0.0066507054,0.0200872775,0.0201903731,0.0362167321,0.0126379812,0.0320117138,-0.0034106236,0.0734003112,0.0179675128,-0.0207141265,-0.0433168337,0.0017964873,-0.0393279791,0.0009234371,-0.0237568188,-0.0097212372,-0.0332677923]}

{"chunk":"Smoking: Refrain from smoking 30 minutes before the test. What Are the Normal AST Levels?The normal range for AST levels varies depending on a person\u2019s age, gender, and health status. Below are the standard values for different groups:\n\nMales:\n\n\t\nUnder 13 years old: 8\u201360 U\/L\n14 years and older: 8\u201348 U\/L\n\n\nFemales:\n\t\nUnder 13 years old: 8\u201350 U\/L\n14 years and older: 8\u201343 U\/L\n\n\nPregnant Women:\n\t\nFirst trimester: 3\u201323 U\/L\nSecond trimester: 3\u201333 U\/L\nThird trimester: 4\u201332 U\/L\n\n\n\nNote: The units of measurement and the normal ranges can differ depending on the laboratory and the specific methods used.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More\nWhat Do Abnormal AST Levels Mean?Abnormal AST levels can indicate a variety of health issues, typically related to the liver, heart, or muscles. Both high and low AST levels are significant and may point to underlying medical conditions that require further investigation. AST High LevelsWhen AST levels are higher than the normal range, it often suggests that the liver, heart, or muscles have been damaged. The damage causes the release of AST into the bloodstream, where it is detected during a test. Here are some common causes of elevated AST levels:\n\nLiver disease: Conditions like hepatitis, cirrhosis, or fatty liver disease can cause AST levels to rise as the liver is damaged. Heart attack: Damage to the heart muscle during a heart attack can lead to a spike in AST. Intense physical activity: Exercise that strains the muscles can temporarily raise AST levels due to muscle breakdown. Obesity: Excess body weight can contribute to fatty liver, which affects AST levels. Alcohol abuse: Chronic heavy drinking can damage the liver and elevate AST levels. Extensive burns or trauma: Significant injury to the skin or body tissues can cause AST levels to rise as cells are damaged. Pancreatitis: Inflammation of the pancreas can also lead to high AST levels. RecommendationsIf your AST levels are high, it\u2019s important to identify the underlying cause and take steps to address it. Here are some recommendations for managing elevated AST levels:\n\nReduce alcohol consumption: Avoiding or limiting alcohol intake can help protect the liver from further damage. Adopt a balanced diet: Focus on liver-friendly foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins. Stay active, but avoid overexertion: Regular exercise is important for overall health, but avoid pushing your body too hard to prevent muscle strain. Manage your weight: Maintaining a healthy weight can reduce the risk of liver problems and lower AST levels. Consult a healthcare professional: Follow up with your doctor for further tests or treatments to address the underlying condition. AST Low LevelsWhile less common, low AST levels can also occur and may indicate certain health conditions. These low levels might not be as widely discussed, but they still require attention to ensure the body is functioning properly. Here are some possible causes of low AST levels:\n\nLiver damage: In the case of severe liver damage or cirrhosis, AST production might decrease, leading to lower levels in the blood. Malnutrition: Prolonged starvation or nutrient deficiencies can lower enzyme production, including AST. Aging: As people age, enzyme levels, including AST, can naturally decline. Certain metabolic disorders: Rare metabolic conditions can affect the body's ability to produce AST. RecommendationsIf your AST levels are too low, there are a few things you can do to improve them:\n\nImprove your nutrition: Ensure your diet includes a balance of essential nutrients, particularly protein-rich foods, to support enzyme production. Consult a healthcare provider: If low AST levels are related to liver disease or other serious conditions, it\u2019s important to work with your doctor to manage these issues. Consider supplements: In some cases, supplements or medications might be recommended by your doctor to address deficiencies. Tailored SupplementsTake the checkup quiz, explore your personal supplement kit, and have it delivered straight to your door.Learn More\nWhich Specialist Should You Consult?If your AST levels are abnormal, your next step may involve consulting a specialist who can help identify the underlying cause and recommend appropriate treatment. Here are the specialists you might need to see depending on the issue:\n\nHepatologist: A specialist in liver diseases who can help with conditions like hepatitis or cirrhosis. Cardiologist: If heart issues such as a heart attack are suspected, a cardiologist will evaluate your heart health and manage any related conditions. Endocrinologist: For metabolic disorders affecting AST levels, an endocrinologist can offer guidance. Gastroenterologist: This specialist focuses on digestive health and can help manage pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal conditions.

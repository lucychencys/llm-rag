It's essential for various bodily functions, including building cell membranes, producing hormones, and making vitamin D. Cholesterol travels through your bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins, which are combinations of fat (lipid) and protein. While cholesterol is vital for your health, having too much of it can lead to serious health problems. There are two main sources of cholesterol in your body:\n\nEndogenous Cholesterol: This type of cholesterol is produced by your liver. Your liver makes all the cholesterol your body needs to function properly. The liver regulates cholesterol levels, ensuring you have enough for your body's needs without overproducing it. Exogenous Cholesterol: This cholesterol comes from your diet, specifically from animal-based foods like meat, poultry, and dairy products. These foods contain dietary cholesterol, which can add to the cholesterol produced by your liver.","book":"Cholesterol: Key Facts, Levels and Health Risks","embedding":[0.030600749,0.0429083966,-0.0228597615,-0.0888472572,-0.023422597,0.0628634915,0.0051218923,-0.0086381836,-0.0187848564,0.0437520891,-0.0245670676,-0.0155393342,0.002340286,-0.0641891956,-0.0287194271,-0.0703434199,-0.0285893828,-0.0567167364,-0.0992168114,-0.0526921265,-0.0094538908,-0.019747762,0.0090256687,-0.003182977,-0.0259548668,-0.0044914959,-0.0384533033,-0.0103146033,0.0288685691,-0.0558759943,-0.0098407995,0.0577205569,0.0165767092,-0.0567047484,0.0451200083,-0.044631239,-0.0149838887,0.030716313,0.0197632816,-0.0074415486,-0.0118764751,-0.0280557815,-0.0336019807,0.0343724191,-0.058445219,-0.0656969696,0.0245916508,0.0711363181,-0.0287418235,0.0595520176,0.0390614793,0.0614597723,-0.0154433558,0.032820899,0.025855761,-0.0480145738,-0.0103869773,0.0464820191,-0.0123218456,-0.0234733913,-0.0382832363,0.0072413273,-0.020843178,-0.0310159065,-0.0051195105,0.0269340966,0.0082000447,-0.0753558725,-0.0713217109,-0.0015186177,0.0182368923,0.0335776992,0.0040741405,-0.0364374891,0.0523503497,-0.0375647284,-0.0019000346,-0.0366572142,-0.0077109048,0.019171603,-0.0394320972,-0.0191935152,0.0366343558,0.0989158973,-0.0073322635,-0.0032430701,0.0118229073,-0.085824661,-0.0298565812,0.0504512936,0.1112903729,-0.0293063466,0.0100376103,0.0094599538,0.0323888622,-0.0276237261,-0.0734504685,-0.089941144,0.0997076184,0.0570848323,0.0116298068,-0.0002231929,0.035409946,-0.0724010319,0.0526736341,0.006603803,0.0451633967,-0.0242838636,-0.0194164086,-0.0038438984,0.0539687574,-0.0298442263,-0.0113307452,-0.0483454615,0.0048522111,-0.0196870975,-0.0288277976,0.0482052527,-0.0433785282,-0.0149825569,-0.0123089207,0.0434402749,-0.0042653261,0.0285472758,0.0333782211,0.0028119897,0.0092687858,-0.0471469648,-0.0344735645,-0.0207579285,0.0430852883,-0.1041252241,0.0347391888,-0.0033288836,-0.0072777141,0.027297521,0.0456015654,0.0145124318,-0.0022335162,0.0256696045,0.0026673176,-0.0211671032,-0.0352206975,0.007420464,-0.036292132,-0.0227876771,0.058967445,0.033476349,-0.0059275683,-0.0523342751,0.0051346747,-0.0110216131,0.0913056955,-0.0071164789,0.0278134774,0.0140120573,0.0417145304,-0.0363196209,0.0038421326,0.0076033752,-0.0133682787,-0.0676679313,-0.0193425007,0.0339858904,-0.0730435997,0.0116805444,0.0193828829,-0.0393029936,0.021203598,-0.0190095417,-0.0316681899,-0.0594860353,-0.0673383698,-0.1792049557,-0.0280320849,0.0042810356,0.0260443166,-0.025286153,-0.0035301624,-0.0522684492,0.0908963233,0.0208710469,0.010434527,-0.1144117042,0.0424683243,0.0305144694,0.0593946092,0.0179522727,0.0765541941,0.0691267624,-0.0447142385,-0.0187523756,-0.0054193977,-0.0101890713,-0.0198563039,0.0134457182,0.0171386674,0.0170104466,0.0008768746,-0.0198251326,0.0107601061,-0.0602327771,0.0446657836,0.0054255351,-0.0276320968,0.0390983596,-0.0571841784,-0.0342982933,0.0727978647,-0.0293164439,-0.0071378183,-0.0374864116,-0.0414892919,-0.0322186053,-0.0161700547,0.0066707474,-0.0214442313,-0.0111942235,0.066693075,0.0445498638,-0.0076113967,-0.0116402637,0.0309314672,-0.0080217505,0.0072839777,0.0381032936,-0.0492368974,-0.0205990486,0.0450419225,-0.0129091861,-0.0291410368,0.0225955229,0.0180610716,-0.0461222231,-0.0174942613,-0.0373892412,-0.0018220479,-0.0009608981,0.0003899625,-0.0413133055,0.0180542339,-0.0026681691,0.0307417531,0.0315589532,-0.0218358152,-0.0404403619,0.0618951283,0.0156133892,-0.0084818723,-0.069369331,0.0114069656,-0.0281397458,-0.0016480094,-0.0463564768,0.037612021,-0.0022063125]}

{"chunk":"There is also a less commonly discussed type called very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL)LDL is often referred to as \"bad\" cholesterol. This is because high levels of LDL cholesterol can lead to plaque buildup in your arteries. Plaque is a thick, hard deposit that can clog arteries and make them less flexible, a condition known as atherosclerosis. When plaque builds up, it can lead to serious health problems, such as heart attacks or strokes. LDL cholesterol contributes to plaque buildup by depositing cholesterol directly into the walls of your arteries. Over time, this buildup narrows the arteries, restricting blood flow and increasing the risk of cardiovascular events. Managing LDL levels is crucial for reducing the risk of heart disease. Very Low-Density Lipoprotein (VLDL)VLDL is another type of \"bad\" cholesterol. It primarily carries triglycerides, which are fats, in the blood. Like LDL, high levels of VLDL can contribute to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. Triglycerides are necessary for energy, but having too many in your blood can increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Managing VLDL levels is important because high VLDL can indicate an increased risk of heart disease. VLDL can be reduced through a healthy diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle changes, similar to the strategies used to manage LDL cholesterol. High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL)HDL is known as \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from your bloodstream. HDL carries cholesterol away from the arteries and back to the liver, where it can be processed and removed from the body. This helps prevent the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke. Having higher levels of HDL cholesterol is beneficial because it can offset the harmful effects of LDL cholesterol. Think of HDL as the cleanup crew for your arteries, ensuring that excess cholesterol doesn't lead to dangerous plaque formation. Why Cholesterol Levels Matter\nThe Relationship Between Cholesterol Levels and Heart Disease RiskCholesterol levels are a crucial factor in determining your risk for heart disease. High levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, combined with low levels of HDL cholesterol, can lead to the development of atherosclerosis. This is a condition where plaque builds up in the arteries, narrowing them and making it harder for blood to flow through. How High Cholesterol Leads to Plaque Buildup and AtherosclerosisWhen you have high cholesterol, especially high LDL levels, cholesterol particles can start to deposit in the walls of your arteries. Over time, these deposits form plaques. Plaque buildup, or atherosclerosis, can restrict blood flow to vital organs, including the heart and brain. This plaque can also become unstable and rupture, leading to the formation of blood clots. These clots can block blood flow completely, causing serious health issues like heart attacks and strokes. Potential Consequences of High CholesterolHigh cholesterol can lead to several serious health problems, including:\n\nCoronary Artery Disease: Plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the heart can cause chest pain (angina) and heart attacks. Peripheral Artery Disease: This occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the legs and arms, leading to pain and mobility issues. Carotid Artery Disease: Plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the brain can cause strokes or transient ischemic attacks (mini-strokes). Other signs of high cholesterol may include yellowish deposits called xanthomas on the skin, particularly around the eyes, and the formation of white or gray rings around the corneas of the eyes (arcus senilis). Managing your cholesterol levels is crucial for reducing the risk of these conditions.","book":"Cholesterol: Key Facts, Levels and Health Risks","embedding":[0.0187223535,0.0130498353,-0.0123103382,-0.0866070017,-0.0207911171,-0.007840367,0.0020508952,-0.0416944139,-0.0023304063,0.0349492729,-0.03269789,-0.0006555973,0.0281510819,-0.0493681394,-0.0281274877,-0.0511306748,-0.0383314118,-0.0603703447,-0.0932317525,-0.042093806,-0.0303247813,0.0111720776,0.0025533582,-0.0452203192,-0.0381055325,-0.0055259331,-0.031307403,-0.0232257973,-0.0087591531,-0.0768950433,-0.0116035733,0.0341285765,0.0095067378,-0.0704370514,0.0075035268,-0.0147502441,-0.0293736272,0.0401771069,0.0115439603,-0.0172250327,-0.0098554008,-0.0092384731,-0.0388461798,0.0418137535,-0.0541615486,-0.0274539273,0.0375079848,0.0637957677,-0.0186032653,0.0545696616,0.0215527005,0.0615536422,0.0112564052,0.0544645563,0.0162723958,-0.0810035765,-0.0159333423,0.0560322739,-0.0133812698,-0.0129983453,-0.0417921916,-0.0135945594,-0.0240539927,-0.0393272191,-0.0132109784,0.0109910285,-0.033054553,-0.0635034144,-0.0354558751,0.014313533,0.0134630343,0.0360599607,0.0232752264,-0.054719165,0.0568812191,-0.027596781,0.0364973731,-0.0397383347,-0.0100699002,-0.018161986,-0.0725120232,-0.024823647,0.0381333865,0.127080664,-0.0059667337,0.0232895929,-0.0219654609,-0.0929486081,-0.0359745994,0.046122808,0.0724095106,-0.0051868893,-0.0023116372,0.0379521884,0.0245484766,-0.048080761,-0.0850321427,-0.0873107687,0.1173991114,0.0695813373,0.0066708787,-0.0142818959,0.0062435325,-0.1196730658,0.0775345489,0.0297503062,0.0707672313,-0.0307606887,-0.0258592311,0.0045319558,0.0286781397,-0.0154873701,-0.0027834692,-0.0074787373,0.0217030328,-0.0128157185,-0.0008385089,0.0079524461,-0.0552505143,-0.010791732,-0.0273052156,0.0682834908,-0.0137751913,0.0298551619,0.0426784679,0.0102557773,-0.0231426731,-0.0369072929,-0.0600352809,-0.0367324166,0.056617856,-0.0972436741,0.0037317355,-0.014056664,-0.0144774169,0.008308487,0.0446018465,0.0376644172,-0.002650043,0.0765570998,-0.0121884197,-0.0209263004,-0.0089902934,0.0223917309,0.0088047311,-0.0158956144,0.0545637794,0.0636366829,0.0018022818,-0.0297540314,-0.0130103733,-0.0323791206,0.0323622152,-0.0025318479,0.0181723274,0.0502010696,0.0276049618,-0.0504058897,0.012894162,0.0298686698,0.011628639,-0.052065298,-0.0344764888,0.0170206837,-0.0182987135,0.0644123331,0.0355444439,-0.0587404817,0.0224891361,0.0109029729,-0.0111672003,-0.0225553941,-0.067694895,-0.1761227548,-0.0388066806,-0.0006054106,0.030981658,0.0053233658,-0.0236533992,-0.0668798462,0.1202412471,0.0244751126,0.0227214955,-0.0767706335,0.0260035805,0.0239765104,0.0216478985,0.0092897024,0.0800489336,0.0693200231,-0.0459707454,-0.0065556155,-0.0003479267,0.028817758,-0.0231296383,0.0239558499,0.0121686589,0.0163593162,0.0409579016,-0.0104416236,0.0218728129,-0.036923591,0.0627995506,-0.0129495058,0.018772833,0.0433191843,-0.0276138745,-0.0208985396,0.0986834168,0.0006186344,-0.0342224874,-0.0022195554,-0.051882308,-0.0352655351,-0.0011862974,0.0246104039,-0.0214703754,-0.0115470551,0.027835425,-0.0159515291,0.010761044,-0.045550961,0.0105264485,0.0145955831,-0.0136673637,-0.0136044575,-0.0470624529,-0.0189745333,0.0462184176,-0.0373126417,-0.0477868281,0.0131494589,-0.0109167928,-0.0360197015,-0.0360998064,-0.0124115339,-0.0184625443,0.0109929089,-0.0227286685,-0.0331433155,0.0053712577,0.0220487919,0.0432638824,0.0163790938,0.0035048639,-0.0199330803,0.0766601413,0.0329653099,0.0013314092,-0.0578440055,0.011053971,-0.0134004243,0.0184197277,-0.0143384393,0.0343992673,0.0045095626]}
{"chunk":"Regular testing, a healthy lifestyle, and working with your healthcare provider can help you maintain healthy cholesterol levels and protect your heart health. How to Measure Cholesterol\nLipid Panel TestTo determine your cholesterol levels, healthcare providers use a blood test called a lipid panel or lipid profile. This test measures the amount of different types of cholesterol and fats in your blood. The lipid panel provides the following key measurements:\n\nTotal Cholesterol: The overall amount of cholesterol in your blood. LDL Cholesterol: The \"bad\" cholesterol that can lead to plaque buildup in arteries. HDL Cholesterol: The \"good\" cholesterol that helps remove excess cholesterol from your blood. Triglycerides: A type of fat in the blood that can increase the risk of heart disease if levels are too high. Preparation for a Cholesterol TestProper preparation for a cholesterol test is essential for accurate results. Here are some important steps to follow:\n\nFasting: Most lipid panel tests require fasting for 9-12 hours before the test. This means you should avoid eating or drinking anything except water during this period. Fasting ensures that food and drink do not affect your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Medications: Inform your healthcare provider about any medications, supplements, or vitamins you are taking, as some can affect cholesterol levels. Hydration: Drink plenty of water before the test to stay hydrated, as dehydration can affect blood test results. Avoid Alcohol: Refrain from consuming alcohol for at least 24 hours before the test, as it can influence triglyceride levels. Cholesterol Levels by Age and SexNote: Test results can differ based on factors such as your age, gender, health history, the testing method, and other variables. Your results may not necessarily indicate a problem. Consult with your healthcare provider to understand what your specific test results mean for you.

High-Risk Individuals: People with cardiovascular disease or those at elevated risk should have their cholesterol and other risk factors assessed more often, as advised by their healthcare provider.","book":"Cholesterol: Key Facts, Levels and Health Risks","embedding":[0.0305939037,0.0334948264,-0.045558352,-0.0692044348,0.0129613699,0.0454791076,-0.0111050075,-0.027676452,-0.0270973053,0.0345047824,-0.0061453548,-0.0034060187,0.0194036886,0.0020743371,-0.0534183569,-0.0206683204,-0.0159121174,-0.0416991711,-0.1002407372,-0.0442496128,-0.0050187996,0.003312615,-0.0068525607,0.0005021466,-0.0152598321,-0.0267676543,-0.0518335067,-0.0367642529,0.0115142092,-0.0769126639,0.0055300663,0.0430948474,0.0319266357,-0.0412424691,0.0676178634,0.003194453,-0.0036788769,0.0181834418,0.0358421281,-0.0155755021,-0.0297779776,-0.0292397104,-0.0251861401,0.0423398353,-0.0481391586,-0.0489296764,0.0037812961,0.0295521338,-0.0346782804,0.0444877706,0.0135359932,0.0679822415,-0.0558176525,0.0275152978,0.0151251294,-0.0674360618,-0.0205661654,-0.0005388461,-0.0016132488,-0.0265547391,-0.0040762061,0.0014911757,-0.0165331345,-0.0274123792,0.0034331286,0.010435625,0.0325451232,-0.0525392592,-0.0458304919,-0.0241212491,0.0357886627,0.0144189671,0.0134868659,0.0013774496,0.0238404348,-0.0038944138,0.0393882208,-0.0438263267,-0.0029947269,0.0115947416,-0.0552097671,-0.0256753583,0.0404206961,0.130060643,-0.008830158,0.0149804223,0.0161556024,-0.106241934,-0.0148149226,0.0319970697,0.1259843558,-0.0315729454,0.0004356452,-0.0270703901,0.0543013848,-0.0554755442,-0.0945900083,-0.0815013424,0.0934759229,0.0471923612,0.0457344167,-0.0042200009,0.0135296099,-0.0854461119,0.0495498478,-0.0003289447,0.0558354445,-0.0073387315,-0.0331638567,0.0001191961,0.0265433677,0.0022223522,-0.0013097279,-0.020417599,-0.0176313631,-0.0109663056,-0.0257606003,0.0358478352,-0.0272746813,0.0316733532,-0.0105231218,0.0807299539,-0.0242922585,0.0496291444,0.0424576364,-0.0003538252,-0.0104811816,-0.0272129755,-0.0470210686,-0.0395789407,-0.0086347759,-0.1104569361,0.0229184851,0.0008918971,-0.0206986647,-0.0017596002,0.0502879359,0.013223893,-0.014848412,0.0773511007,-0.0257899705,-0.0495212972,-0.0497810282,0.0222130362,-0.0125195188,-0.0135647375,0.0217965897,0.0361867845,-0.0301677696,-0.0114194779,-0.0358519517,-0.0068452857,0.0760237947,0.0007239713,-0.0083411364,0.0484148301,0.0005600115,-0.0039904509,0.0308260154,0.0253140572,0.0346412137,-0.0850651935,0.007695558,0.0184307899,-0.0354370996,0.0525657572,0.0064680306,-0.0449271798,0.0268147551,-0.0035426184,-0.01688301,-0.0131223705,-0.0278065931,-0.1731432527,-0.0055289525,0.0226654913,0.0032564031,-0.0149451531,-0.0129005946,-0.0598171912,0.1472125351,0.0048983665,0.0134933442,-0.069582589,-0.0034240563,0.0259532165,0.0393111482,-0.0101501318,0.0606606677,0.0667200536,-0.0422735065,-0.0091966707,-0.0008126518,0.0381294787,-0.0401684269,0.0267205704,-0.0056089754,0.010248173,0.0482097343,-0.0391934849,0.0078285364,-0.0106221465,0.0538798012,0.0260279234,0.0286432784,0.0724940002,-0.0112016704,0.0125456061,0.0711404011,-0.0080672726,-0.0245161708,-0.0003632277,-0.0439152606,-0.0076248269,-0.0115676317,0.0208261628,-0.0228595398,-0.0045753731,0.0028547549,0.0246113986,-0.0078464616,-0.0164627526,0.0078930911,0.0168532301,-0.0066607255,0.0284939818,-0.045109462,-0.0101391934,0.0181225631,-0.0262119304,-0.0333874784,0.0342672765,-0.018964123,-0.030775886,-0.0090114893,-0.0233313311,0.0143569605,0.0022039476,0.0040885978,-0.0315437354,0.0065334304,0.0517798774,0.0538220778,0.00363863,0.0007873722,-0.0252987612,0.0788264871,0.0268882979,0.0001248604,-0.0251602735,0.0221988894,-0.0215857551,0.0182144102,-0.0135129932,-0.0125685111,0.0019861762]}
{"chunk":"Personalized Health Advice: Your healthcare professional will explain what your cholesterol levels mean, discuss treatment options if necessary, and provide guidance tailored to your health needs. Risk Factors for High Cholesterol\nDietary Factors Influencing Cholesterol LevelsFoods That Raise LDL Cholesterol:\n\nSaturated Fats: Found in red meat, full-fat dairy products, butter, and certain oils like coconut and palm oil. Trans Fats: Present in many processed and fried foods, as well as baked goods made with partially hydrogenated oils. Cholesterol-Rich Foods: Found in high amounts in organ meats, shellfish, and full-fat dairy products. Foods That Help Lower Cholesterol:\n\nSoluble Fiber: Found in oats, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. It helps reduce the absorption of cholesterol in the bloodstream. Healthy Fats: Found in nuts, seeds, avocados, and olive oil. These can help increase HDL cholesterol and reduce LDL cholesterol. Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Found in fatty fish like salmon, mackerel, and sardines. They help lower triglycerides and may improve heart health. Whole Grains: Oats, barley, and whole wheat are good sources of soluble fiber. Lean Proteins: Choose lean meats, fish, and plant-based proteins like beans and lentils\n\nLifestyle Factors Affecting Cholesterol\nExercise: Regular physical activity helps increase HDL cholesterol and lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise most days of the week. Smoking: Smoking lowers HDL cholesterol and damages the walls of blood vessels, making it easier for LDL cholesterol to accumulate. Quitting smoking improves HDL levels and overall heart health. Alcohol Consumption: Drinking alcohol in moderation can have a positive effect on HDL cholesterol, but excessive drinking increases the risk of high triglycerides and other health issues. Stick to recommended guidelines for alcohol consumption. Genetic Factors and Family HistoryGenetics play a significant role in determining your cholesterol levels. If high cholesterol runs in your family, you may be at a higher risk, regardless of lifestyle choices. Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic condition that results in very high LDL cholesterol levels from a young age. If you have a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease, it's essential to monitor your cholesterol levels regularly and take preventive measures. Medical Conditions Leading to High CholesterolCertain medical conditions can also contribute to high cholesterol levels. These include:\n\nDiabetes: High blood sugar levels can lead to higher LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis. Hypothyroidism: An underactive thyroid can cause an increase in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. Kidney Disease: Chronic kidney disease can lead to higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Liver Disease: Since the liver plays a crucial role in processing cholesterol, liver disease can disrupt cholesterol levels. Managing these conditions through proper medical care and lifestyle adjustments is vital for controlling cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of heart disease. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is cholesterol and why is it important for your health?Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance found in all cells of the body. It is essential for building cell membranes, producing hormones, and making vitamin D. However, having too much cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases.Why is LDL cholesterol considered \"bad\" and how does it affect your arteries?LDL cholesterol is considered \"bad\" because it can deposit cholesterol on the walls of arteries, forming plaque. This plaque buildup narrows the arteries and restricts blood flow, increasing the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases.What are the health risks associated with high cholesterol levels?High cholesterol levels can lead to the development of atherosclerosis, a condition where plaque builds up in the arteries. This can cause coronary artery disease, heart attacks, strokes, and peripheral artery disease.How does HDL cholesterol protect against heart disease?HDL cholesterol is known as \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it to the liver for elimination. Higher levels of HDL cholesterol are associated with a lower risk of heart disease.How to Lower Cholesterol?Effective ways to lower cholesterol levels include eating a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats; engaging in regular physical activity; avoiding smoking; limiting alcohol intake; and maintaining a healthy weight. Sometimes, medications may also be prescribed by healthcare providers.How often should you get your cholesterol levels checked?Adults should have their cholesterol levels checked every 4 to 6 years. However, individuals with risk factors for heart disease or a family history of high cholesterol may need to have their levels checked more frequently.Can high cholesterol cause headaches?While high cholesterol doesn't directly cause headaches, it can contribute to conditions that affect blood flow, such as atherosclerosis. Restricted blood flow to the brain might lead to headaches or more serious conditions like stroke, making it important to monitor cholesterol levels.Have more questions?Ask AI Doctor\n\n\n","book":"Cholesterol: Key Facts, Levels and Health Risks","embedding":[0.041461233,0.0252277665,-0.036124222,-0.0797831118,0.0025272758,0.0295002908,0.0105163213,-0.0462963954,-0.0141087957,0.030458143,-0.0047874125,0.0149498889,0.0263969265,-0.0367493629,-0.0548091382,-0.0590008236,-0.0020982849,-0.0269557144,-0.0671450123,-0.0401446857,-0.0267332681,0.0088187121,0.0098303063,-0.0122125568,-0.0455343276,0.0028355122,-0.0446438156,-0.0242636688,0.0047034519,-0.0788993239,0.0070737307,0.0404404588,0.0199425705,-0.0591285937,0.0432830714,-0.0390914753,-0.0394400544,0.0225365274,0.0084649259,-0.0471248664,-0.0182566047,-0.0330220722,-0.0310157295,0.0385093242,-0.0681807175,-0.041302003,0.0015876564,0.0663133487,0.0011098941,0.0443221331,0.0155203724,0.0586666204,0.0190430209,0.026695054,0.0204406641,-0.0629538596,-0.037339665,0.0683283135,0.0048330147,-0.0043887352,-0.0312625393,-0.0339918993,-0.0249614324,-0.0358522236,-0.0024110407,0.0184928905,-0.0122997127,-0.0593958795,-0.0398768187,-0.002197305,0.0252179429,0.0101910131,-0.0034575483,-0.0252809227,0.0290802233,-0.0282707121,0.0223666914,-0.0552999042,-0.0131265894,-0.0196165796,-0.0534610413,-0.0251841471,0.0065775677,0.1171888709,-0.0244916864,0.0196545497,0.0095189,-0.0660709813,-0.0276239868,0.0250725169,0.0803232566,-0.0091409767,0.0260398835,0.0137284137,0.0482595339,-0.0361532979,-0.08190763,-0.0894914195,0.0780953467,0.0678291321,0.0390978232,-0.0167049896,0.0426800512,-0.1159459949,0.0713383257,0.0619425513,0.0591057949,-0.0378478765,-0.0387862474,0.0032516981,0.0752558708,-0.0015844604,-0.0016032304,-0.0259736069,0.0110809412,-0.0128263244,-0.0334411934,0.021377854,-0.0642247126,-0.0151143214,-0.0217423048,0.0776626095,-0.0103384405,0.0445000678,0.0619711727,-0.0003750551,0.0084938146,-0.0347115099,-0.0378647111,-0.0470700189,0.057385426,-0.106636472,-0.014162316,-0.0087933298,0.0157667994,0.0439420305,0.0344418213,0.0046743238,0.0041539595,0.076652512,-0.018286109,-0.0335688442,-0.0409779847,0.0021368763,-0.0198541917,-0.0269206371,0.0310870465,0.0615153201,-0.0172240324,-0.0016312031,-0.0260571707,-0.0216503665,0.054472018,-0.0354933105,0.0252874419,0.0465347283,0.0347847417,-0.0339960195,-0.0034473459,0.028744081,0.0148881646,-0.0553306267,0.0190717354,0.0163021497,-0.0560469814,0.038848076,0.0333307423,-0.0537236184,-0.00003954,0.0471592844,-0.0140578104,-0.0531813465,-0.0655179471,-0.189031288,-0.0235639345,0.0079114512,0.0491260663,-0.0007566033,-0.0200316533,-0.0602781884,0.1200842336,0.0093796365,0.0403489098,-0.0761109143,0.0284251645,0.0143494373,0.0396275036,-0.011378685,0.0755624026,0.0609236583,-0.0571626686,-0.0269386452,-0.003321301,0.0205837768,-0.02841294,0.0121522592,0.018963797,0.0233905315,0.0238902662,-0.0286362581,0.0053393217,-0.0451109335,0.047617387,0.0187072046,0.0045610964,0.0716842338,-0.0283855088,0.0043937811,0.0666955709,-0.0103786942,-0.0392408334,-0.0026005823,-0.0527590923,-0.0218136031,0.0074039847,0.0278504975,-0.0238391496,0.0010914995,0.036065463,0.0020514284,-0.0129402261,-0.0690784007,0.0199728012,-0.023716066,0.00170721,0.0275356546,-0.0364940837,-0.0497003272,0.0240832269,-0.0104523543,-0.0422464535,0.0314261839,-0.0185766909,-0.0261095203,0.0012618668,-0.0343568996,0.019740155,0.0280147456,-0.0189537853,-0.0429256633,0.003995114,0.021481894,0.0365075245,-0.0083642481,-0.0245891139,-0.0271770507,0.0650418401,0.0141329998,-0.0089177703,-0.0508555509,0.0209671054,-0.0146380635,0.0105714034,-0.0086188633,0.0268721841,-0.013085668]}

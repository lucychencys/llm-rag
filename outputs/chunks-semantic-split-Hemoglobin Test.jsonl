{"chunk":"Hemoglobin Test\nWhat is a Hemoglobin Test? A hemoglobin test measures the levels of hemoglobin in your blood. Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. If your hemoglobin levels are abnormal, it may be a sign that you have a blood disorder. Other names: Hb, Hgb\n\nWhat is it used for? A hemoglobin test is often used to check for anemia, a condition in which your body has fewer red blood cells than normal. If you have anemia, the cells in your body don't get all the oxygen they need. Hemoglobin tests are measured as part of a complete blood count (CBC). Why do I need a hemoglobin test? Your health care provider may order the test as part of a routine exam, or if you have:\n\nSymptoms of anemia, which include weakness, dizziness, and cold hands and feet\nA family history of thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, or other inherited blood disorder\nA diet low in iron and other minerals\nA long-term infection\nExcessive blood loss from an injury or surgical procedure\nWhat happens during a hemoglobin test? A health care professional will take a blood sample from a vein in your arm, using a small needle. After the needle is inserted, a small amount of blood will be collected into a test tube or vial. You may feel a little sting when the needle goes in or out. This usually takes less than five minutes. Will I need to do anything to prepare for the test? You don't need any special preparation for a hemoglobin test. If your health care provider has ordered other tests on your blood sample, you may need to fast (not eat or drink) for several hours before the test.","book":"Hemoglobin Test"}

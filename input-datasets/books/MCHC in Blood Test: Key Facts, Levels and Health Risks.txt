The MCHC blood test measures the concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells, helping diagnose conditions like anemia and liver disease. Managing abnormal MCHC levels is crucial for ensuring your body can carry oxygen effectively.ContentsWhat Is Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)?When Is MCHC Testing Recommended?How Is MCHC Testing Conducted?What Are the Normal MCHC Levels?What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?
What Is Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)?Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC) is a measure of the average concentration of hemoglobin within a specific volume of red blood cells. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. MCHC helps determine how much oxygen your blood can transport, as it reflects the density of hemoglobin in the cells.
In the body, hemoglobin plays a crucial role in delivering oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs and returning carbon dioxide to the lungs for exhalation. The MCHC value is often used in diagnosing conditions related to the blood, such as different forms of anemia. 
This biomarker, when combined with other measurements, helps identify underlying health problems related to oxygen transport and red blood cell health.Lab Test InterpretationUpload your lab tests, receive detailed interpretations, personalized insights and recommendations.Learn More
When Is MCHC Testing Recommended?MCHC testing is often included as part of a broader diagnostic process when certain symptoms or health issues are present. Your healthcare provider may recommend this test in various situations, including:

When symptoms of anemia are present, such as fatigue, pale skin, or weakness.
If there is unexplained tiredness or difficulty concentrating.
As part of a routine health check-up to monitor overall blood health.
During pregnancy, to ensure both mother and baby are receiving enough oxygen.
When assessing the effectiveness of treatment for anemia or other blood disorders.
In cases of suspected nutritional deficiencies (such as iron, B6, or vitamin C).

How Is MCHC Testing Conducted?MCHC is measured through a simple blood test, usually performed as part of a Complete Blood Count (CBC). The CBC is a common test used to evaluate overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, such as anemia, infection, and other conditions affecting blood cells.

A healthcare professional draws a small sample of blood, typically from a vein in your arm.
The blood sample is sent to a laboratory where machines calculate the MCHC value by dividing the hemoglobin count by the hematocrit (the percentage of red blood cells in the blood).

Test Preparations
In most cases, no special preparation is needed for the MCHC test. However, your doctor may ask you to avoid certain medications or supplements that could interfere with the results, depending on your health condition.
What Are the Normal MCHC Levels?Normal MCHC levels can vary slightly depending on age and specific circumstances, such as pregnancy. Here are the general reference ranges:

Adults: 320–360 grams per liter (g/L)
Children:
	
Up to 1 year old — 290–370 g/L
Up to 3 years old — 280–380 g/L
Up to 12 years old — 280–360 g/L
Up to 19 years old — 330–340 g/L


Pregnant women:
	
First trimester: 325–353 g/L
Second trimester: 324–352 g/L
Third trimester: 319–355 g/L

What Do Abnormal Levels Mean?Abnormal MCHC levels can indicate various health problems, and it's important to understand the potential causes of both high and low values.
MCHC High LevelsWhen MCHC levels are higher than normal, this condition is called hyperchromia, and it can indicate certain health issues. Some of the common causes of high MCHC include:

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: A condition where the immune system attacks red blood cells, causing them to break down prematurely.
Liver disease: The liver plays a role in red blood cell production, and any dysfunction may lead to abnormal MCHC levels.
Overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism): An overactive thyroid can increase the production of red blood cells, leading to elevated MCHC levels.
Hereditary spherocytosis: A genetic condition that affects the shape and functionality of red blood cells, causing them to break down faster than normal.
Macrocytic anemia: A type of anemia characterized by abnormally large red blood cells, which can lead to an increased MCHC.

RecommendationsIf you have high MCHC levels, it’s essential to take steps to manage your health. Some recommendations include:

Follow your doctor's advice: Always consult with your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.
Address underlying conditions: Treat any liver, thyroid, or immune system issues that may be contributing to high MCHC.
Regular monitoring: Keep track of your CBC results to ensure your red blood cell health stays balanced.
Maintain a balanced diet: Eat a diet rich in nutrients that support red blood cell health, such as folic acid and vitamin B12.

MCHC Low LevelsWhen MCHC levels are lower than normal, this condition is known as hypochromia, and it often points to issues related to low hemoglobin production or red blood cell health. Causes of low MCHC levels include:

Iron-deficiency anemia: One of the most common causes of low MCHC, where the body lacks sufficient iron to produce adequate hemoglobin.
Vitamin B6 or C deficiency: These vitamins play a critical role in red blood cell production and hemoglobin formation.
Thalassemia: A genetic blood disorder that results in abnormal hemoglobin production.
Lead poisoning: Lead can interfere with the body’s ability to make hemoglobin, leading to low MCHC levels.
Sideroblastic anemia: A rare condition where the body cannot properly utilize iron, even though there’s plenty of it available.

RecommendationsTo improve low MCHC levels, you can follow these practical steps:

Improve your diet: Include iron-rich foods like spinach, red meat, and legumes in your diet.
Avoid exposure to toxins: Limit your exposure to lead and other environmental toxins that can affect blood health.
Seek medical advice: Always work with a healthcare provider to determine the best course of action for treating low MCHC levels.
Take supplements: Under medical guidance, consider taking iron or vitamin supplements (such as B6 or vitamin C) if deficiencies are found.

Which Specialist Should You Consult?If your MCHC levels are abnormal, it’s important to consult a healthcare provider who can guide you through further tests and treatment options. Typically, a general practitioner will handle your initial diagnosis and may refer you to specialists if needed. For example:

A hematologist may be consulted if you have serious blood disorders.
An endocrinologist may assist if the abnormal levels are related to thyroid issues.

Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is MCHC in blood test?MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration) in a blood test measures the average concentration of hemoglobin in red blood cells, helping doctors assess oxygen-carrying capacity and diagnose conditions like anemia or blood disorders.What does low MCHC level mean?A low MCHC level, or hypochromia, indicates that red blood cells have less hemoglobin than normal. This can suggest iron-deficiency anemia, vitamin deficiencies, or certain genetic disorders.What does high MCHC level mean?A high MCHC level, known as hyperchromia, may indicate conditions like autoimmune hemolytic anemia, liver disease, or hereditary blood disorders that affect red blood cell production or structure.Have more questions?Ask AI Doctor
